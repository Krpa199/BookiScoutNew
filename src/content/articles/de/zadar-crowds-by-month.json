  "content": "## Zadar Crowds by Season\n\nZadar's popularity means timing is everything. Here is the direct breakdown.\n\n*   **Peak Season (July-August):** Maximum capacity. The Old Town is packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Accommodation prices double. Lines for everything are long. The heat is intense.\n\n*   **Shoulder Season (May-June, September):** This is the sweet spot. The weather is fantastic for swimming and exploring. Crowds are manageable, and you can enjoy the city's atmosphere without the chaos.\n\n*   **Off-Season (October-April):** Very quiet, almost empty in winter. Many tourist-focused restaurants and tours close down. Best for budget travelers who don't mind the cold and prioritize historical sites over beach time.\n\n*   **Beat the Daily Rush:** Even in summer, the Old Town is quiet before 10 AM. Get up early to see the Forum and Sea Organ in peace. Afternoons are the worst.\n\n*   **A Decisive Tip:** Skip the main Kalelarga street after 10 AM in summer unless you enjoy human traffic jams.",
