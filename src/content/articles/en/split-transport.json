  "content": "## Getting Around Split: A Complete Guide to Transportation (2026)\n\nWelcome to Split, the vibrant heart of the Dalmatian coast! Navigating this stunning city, from its ancient Roman palace to its sun-drenched islands, is part of the adventure. This guide provides all the practical, up-to-date information you need to get around Split like a local, using buses, ferries, ride-sharing, and your own two feet.\n\n### How to Get from Split Airport (SPU) to the City Center\n\nSplit Airport (SPU), also known as Resnik Airport, is located approximately 24 km west of the city center. You have several reliable options to complete this journey.\n\n#### H3: Airport Shuttle Bus (Pleso Prijevoz)\nThis is the most popular and cost-effective option for tourists. The official airport shuttle is operated by Pleso Prijevoz.\n\n*   **Cost**: Approximately €8 per person for a one-way ticket.\n*   **Journey Time**: 30-40 minutes, depending on traffic.\n*   **Schedule**: The bus schedule is synchronized with flight arrivals. They typically depart 30 minutes after each flight lands.\n*   **Drop-off Point**: The main bus terminal (Autobusni Kolodvor) in Split, located right next to the ferry port and a 10-minute walk from the Diocletian's Palace.\n*   **Insider Tip**: You can buy tickets online in advance or from the driver with cash (Euros). The bus is located directly outside the arrivals terminal exit.\n\n#### H3: Public Bus (Promet Line 37)\nThe cheapest, but least direct, option is the local city bus.\n\n*   **Cost**: Approximately €2.10 per person. Tickets are bought from the driver (have small change ready).\n*   **Journey Time**: 45-55 minutes.\n*   **Location**: The bus stop is on the main road just outside the airport terminal. You'll need to walk about 150m.\n*   **Important Note**: This bus does NOT go to the main bus terminal at the port. It stops at a local bus station (Sukoišan), which is a 15-20 minute walk from the Old Town. This is a good option for budget travelers not carrying heavy luggage.\n\n#### H3: Uber, Bolt, and Taxis\nFor maximum convenience, especially with luggage or a group, ride-sharing or a taxi is your best bet.\n\n*   **Cost**: Expect to pay between €30 and €45 for a one-way trip.\n*   **Journey Time**: 25-35 minutes.\n*   **Details**: Uber and Bolt are widely used and generally cheaper than official taxis. You can book them directly from the app upon arrival. The designated ride-sharing pickup area is clearly marked at the airport parking lot. Official taxis are available directly outside the terminal; always confirm the price before you start the journey.\n\n### Navigating Split City: Your Main Options\n\nOnce you're settled, moving around the city and its surroundings is straightforward.\n\n#### H3: Walking: The Best Way to See the Old Town\nThe historic core of Split, including Diocletian's Palace, the Riva promenade, and surrounding medieval streets, is a pedestrian-only zone. Walking is not just the best way to get around—it's the only way. Most key attractions within the old city are within a 1 km radius. For example, the walk from the eastern end of the Riva to Bačvice Beach is a pleasant 1.2 km stroll (about 15 minutes).\n\n#### H3: Public Buses (Promet Split)\nFor destinations outside the immediate center, like Marjan Hill beaches or residential areas, the local bus network operated by Promet is efficient and affordable.\n\n*   **Tickets & Pricing**: A single-ride ticket bought directly from the driver costs €1.50 (valid for Zone 1, which covers the entire city). It's cheaper to buy tickets beforehand at a 'Tisak' or 'iNovine' kiosk for around €1.20.\n*   **How to Use**: Enter through the front door and show your ticket to the driver or validate it in the machine. Bus routes and schedules can be found on the Promet Split website or on Google Maps, which has integrated their data.\n*   **Key Bus Routes for Tourists**:\n    *   **Line 12 (Sv. Frane - Bene)**: Departs from the Riva's west end (near St. Francis Church) and takes you around Marjan Hill, stopping at Bene beach.\n    *   **Line 18 (Tržnica - City Center One)**: Departs from the Green Market (Pazar) and goes to the large City Center One shopping mall.\n    *   **Line 3 (Tržnica - Lovrinac)**: A useful route that passes several popular beaches east of the center, including Firule and Trstenik.\n\n#### H3: Ride-Sharing and Taxis\nUber and Bolt are readily available throughout Split and offer a convenient way to travel short distances for a reasonable price. A typical 10-minute ride across the city will cost between €5-€8. This is a great option for getting to a restaurant in a different neighborhood or returning to your accommodation late at night.\n\n### Island Hopping: Ferries and Catamarans from Split Port\n\nSplit is the main gateway to the central Dalmatian islands. The ferry port is conveniently located adjacent to the main bus and train stations.\n\n*   **Main Ferry Companies**: \n    *   **Jadrolinija**: The state-owned company operates large car ferries and some passenger-only catamarans. This is your choice if you're taking a vehicle.\n    *   **Kapetan Luka (Krilo)**: Specializes in fast, passenger-only catamarans.\n\n*   **Popular Island Routes & Prices (One-Way)**:\n    *   **Split to Hvar Town (Hvar)**: ~1 hour by catamaran, cost is €20-€25.\n    *   **Split to Supetar (Brač)**: ~50 minutes by car ferry, cost is ~€5.50 for a passenger.\n    *   **Split to Bol (Brač)**: ~1 hour by catamaran, cost is ~€20.\n    *   **Split to Vis Town (Vis)**: ~2.5 hours by car ferry, ~1.5 hours by catamaran, cost is ~€7.50.\n\n*   **Insider Tip**: During peak season (July and August), book your ferry or catamaran tickets online at least 2-3 days in advance, especially for popular destinations like Hvar. The ticket booths at the port often have long queues.\n\n### Should You Rent a Car, Scooter, or Bicycle?\n\n#### H3: Renting a Car\nRenting a car is an excellent idea if you plan to take day trips outside of Split to places like Krka National Park (88 km), Plitvice Lakes National Park (240 km), or the city of Zadar (158 km). However, a car is a liability within Split itself.\n\n*   **Parking in Split**: Parking is notoriously difficult and expensive. The city uses a zone system:\n    *   **Zone 1 (Red)**: Closest to the center, ~€1.50/hour, max stay 2 hours.\n    *   **Zone 2 (Yellow)**: A bit further out, ~€1.00/hour.\n    *   **Zone 3 (Green)**: Farthest, ~€0.80/hour.\n*   **Local Tip**: The best place to park for a full day is the large public parking lot near the port (Paromlinska ulica), which costs around €1/hour or €15 for a full day. Alternatively, look for accommodation with guaranteed private parking.\n\n#### H3: Renting a Scooter or Bicycle\nFor exploring the coastline and Marjan Forest Park, renting a scooter or bicycle is a fantastic option. It allows you to bypass traffic and discover hidden beaches easily.\n\n*   **Scooter Rental**: Costs around €30-€45 per day. It's the perfect way to explore beaches like Kašjuni and Bene on Marjan Hill.\n*   **Bicycle Rental**: Many shops offer city bikes and e-bikes. Split is relatively flat along the coast, making for pleasant cycling. Expect to pay around €15-€20 for a full-day rental.\n\n![Split travel experience - transport](https://res.cloudinary.com/dolquhvie/image/upload/v1770247853/bookiscout/split/transport-secondary-1770247851796.jpg)\n",
