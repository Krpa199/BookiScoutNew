Understanding its classic Mediterranean climate is key to planning the perfect trip. This guide provides a detailed month-by-month breakdown of weather conditions, sea temperatures, and essential tips for 2026.\n\nSplit enjoys over 2,600 hours of sunshine annually. Summers are hot and dry, perfect for beach life, while winters are mild and can be wet, offering a peaceful experience for cultural exploration. The shoulder seasons—spring and autumn—provide a blissful balance of warm sun, comfortable temperatures, and fewer crowds.\n\n### Understanding Split's Climate: The Bura and Jugo Winds\n\nTwo winds significantly influence Split's weather and local life:\n*   **Bura:** A cold, dry northeasterly wind that primarily occurs in winter. It brings clear skies and a sharp drop in temperature, feeling much colder than the thermometer suggests. When the Bura blows, ferry services to the islands can be canceled. It's known for its powerful gusts, sometimes exceeding 150 km/h.\n*   **Jugo:** A warm, humid southeasterly wind that blows from the Sahara. It often brings overcast skies, high humidity, and rain. The Jugo can make the sea choppy and is associated with a sluggish, sleepy mood among locals, often called 'fjaka'.\n\n---\n\n## Split Weather by Month: A Detailed Breakdown\n\nHere’s what you can expect from the weather in Split throughout the year, with specific data to help you plan.\n\n### Winter in Split (December, January, February)\n\nWinter is the low season.

Use this time for a long lunch, a nap, or visiting an indoor museum like the Split City Museum (entrance fee: approx. €5).\n\n2.  **Hike Marjan Hill in the Morning:** To get the best views of the city and avoid the heat, start your hike up Marjan Hill before 9:00 AM in the summer. The main viewpoint, Vidilica, is a 1.2 km walk from the Riva.\n\n3.  **Check Ferry Schedules During Wind:** If you plan island day trips in the shoulder or winter seasons, always check the Jadrolinija or Kapetan Luka websites on the morning of your travel. Strong Bura or Jugo winds can lead to last-minute cancellations.\n\n4.  **Pack Layers for Shoulder Seasons:** For visits in May or October, layers are key. A sunny afternoon can feel like summer, but evenings can be cool, especially near the water. A light jacket or sweater is essential.\n\n5.  **Water Shoes are a Must:** Most beaches in Split are pebble, not sand. Water shoes, available for around €10-€15 in local shops, will make your beach experience much more comfortable.",
