  "content": "Rijeka is a city built on hills, stretching along the Kvarner Bay. The typical tourist approach is either to rent a car and battle for parking or to rely on pricey taxis. Both are mistakes. The city's public transport is more than capable—if you know how to use it. Let's bust some common myths.\n\n## Myth 1: You need a car to explore Rijeka properly.\n\n**The Reality:** This is the biggest misconception. Rijeka's city center, including the main promenade Korzo and the market, is a compact and highly walkable pedestrian zone. Renting a car for city exploration means paying for expensive and incredibly scarce parking, only to leave the car parked for hours while you walk.\n\n**The Better Alternative:** Combine walking with the bus system. Walk the entire downtown area, from the ferry terminal to the Governor's Palace. When you want to visit a more distant attraction like Trsat Castle or one of the beaches in Kantrida, hop on a bus. A single ride is cheap, and you'll get there without the stress of navigating narrow, steep streets or finding parking.\n\n## Myth 2: The easiest way to pay is on the bus.\n\n**The Reality:** While you *can* buy a ticket from the driver, it's the worst option. It's more expensive (a single Zone 1 ticket costs around €2.00 from the driver vs. €1.55 at a kiosk) and you're expected to have close to exact change. Holding up a line of commuting locals while you search for coins is not a great look.\n\n**The Better Alternative:** Buy your tickets in advance. Every Tisak and iNovine kiosk (they're on almost every corner) sells bus tickets. For maximum value, ask for a `dnevna karta` (daily ticket), which costs around €4.00 and gives you unlimited rides within Zone 1 for the day. It's the most cost-effective and convenient choice for any tourist.\n\n## Myth 3: The bus network is too confusing for visitors.\n\n**The Reality:** Staring at the complete network map can be intimidating, I'll grant you that. But you don't need to know the whole system. 90% of what a tourist wants to see can be reached using just two or three bus lines, most of which stop at the main hub on Jelačićev Trg.\n\n**The Better Alternative:** Focus on the essentials. \n*   **Line 2:** This is your golden ticket. It takes you from the city center right up to Trsat Castle, a must-see landmark.\n*   **Line 1:** This line runs along the coast, perfect for reaching the Kantrida beach and swimming pool complex.\n*   **Line 8:** Takes you to the Tower Center, Rijeka's largest shopping mall.\n\n> **Insider Perspective:** As locals will tell you, the real challenge isn't the routes, but timing your trip to avoid the 2 PM rush when schools let out and buses get packed.\n\nThe system of zones and ticket types is logical on paper, but the reality for a tourist is that a simple daily ticket from a kiosk bypasses all the confusion.\n\n## What Actually Matters\n\nForget trying to master the entire transport system. To conquer Rijeka's public transport, you only need to remember three things:\n\n1.  **Walk First:** The heart of the city is for your feet.\n2.  **Buy at Kiosks:** Always buy your tickets at a Tisak or iNovine kiosk before boarding. A daily ticket is your best friend.\n3.  **Know Line 2:** If you only learn one route, make it the bus to Trsat Castle.\n\nFollow this, and you'll navigate Rijeka more efficiently and cheaply than the vast majority of visitors.",

      "question": "But isn't ride-sharing like Uber just easier?",
      "answer": "For a very short trip, perhaps. But it's significantly more expensive than the bus. A bus ride to Trsat might cost €1.55 if you buy a single ticket, whereas an Uber for the same steep, uphill journey could easily cost €8-€12. For the price of one Uber trip, you can buy two daily bus tickets."

  "quickAnswer": "Most travelers get this wrong: you don't need a car or expensive taxis in Rijeka. The city's bus system, KD Autotrolej, is extensive and affordable. The secret is knowing how to buy tickets *before* you board and focusing on just a few key lines that cover all major sights.",
