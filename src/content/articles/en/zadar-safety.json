  "content": "## Zadar Safety: The Real Deal\nZadar is safer than most major European cities. Don't overthink it. Just be smart.\n\n*   **Pickpockets:** Crowds are the main risk. The Sea Organ, Sun Salutation, and Kalelarga street are prime spots for theft. Keep your phone in your front pocket and your bag zipped and in front of you.\n*   **Tourist Traps:** Restaurants on the main Riva promenade often have inflated prices for average food. **Don't eat at the first place you see on the waterfront; walk into the side streets for better quality and value.**\n*   **Nightlife:** The old town is busy and safe after dark. The area around the main bus station (Autobusni Kolodvor) can feel a bit deserted late at night; just take a taxi or rideshare if arriving then.\n*   **Beaches & Swimming:** Watch for sea urchins on rocky seabeds. They are common and will ruin your day. Buy a cheap pair of water shoes from a local vendor—you need them.\n*   **Parking:** Do not try to drive or park inside the old town peninsula. It's a maze reserved for residents. Park in the large public lots outside the city walls and walk; it's faster and cheaper.",
