  "content": "## Zadar Transport: The Essentials\n\nZadar is compact. Don't overthink your transport plan. The system is functional, not comprehensive. Here is what you need to know.\n\n*   **Liburnija is the city bus company.** All local routes are run by them. The main hub is the Autobusni Kolodvor (Main Bus Station), not the Old Town.\n*   **The Old Town is a pedestrian zone.** Buses stop outside the city walls or across the pedestrian bridge. Prepare to walk everywhere within the peninsula.\n*   **Buy tickets before you board.** Get them from a Tisak kiosk for the best price. You can buy from the driver, but it costs more and you need cash.\n*   **The airport shuttle is excellent.** It's a dedicated bus service timed with flight arrivals. It runs between the airport, the Main Bus Station, and the Old Town entrance.\n*   **Forget the bus for short stays.** Honestly, if you're staying in or near the Old Town, your feet are your primary and best mode of transportation. Only use the bus for the airport or ferry port.",
