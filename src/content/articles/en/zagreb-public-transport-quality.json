  "content": "## Your Ultimate Guide to Navigating Zagreb by Public Transport in 2026\n\nWelcome to Zagreb, a city where historic charm meets modern efficiency. One of the best examples of this is the public transport system, managed by ZET (Zagrebački Električni Tramvaj). The iconic blue trams are a symbol of the city and, along with a comprehensive bus network, they make getting around both easy and affordable. This guide provides all the data, prices, and insider tips you need to navigate Zagreb like a local in 2026.\n\n## Understanding Zagreb's Public Transport Network\n\nZagreb's network is a well-integrated system of trams, buses, and a famous funicular. It's designed to connect the city center with all surrounding neighborhoods, making it a practical choice over taxis for most journeys.\n\n### Trams: The Backbone of Zagreb\n\nThe tram network is the heart of Zagreb's public transport. With 15 daily routes and 4 night routes, trams cover nearly every major area of the city. They are frequent, generally on time, and offer a scenic way to see Zagreb's architecture.\n\n*   **Operating Hours:** Daily lines typically run from approximately 4:00 AM to midnight.\n*   **Night Lines:** Four dedicated night tram lines (31, 32, 33, 34) operate from midnight to 4:00 AM, running every 30-40 minutes.\n*   **Key Tourist Routes:**\n    *   **Line 6 (Črnomerec - Sopot):** Connects the main bus station (Autobusni Kolodvor) with the main square (Trg bana Jelačića).\n    *   **Line 11 (Črnomerec - Dubec):** A major east-west line running through the main square.\n    *   **Line 12 (Ljubljanica - Dubrava):** Another key line passing through the city center.\n    *   **Lines 14 & 17:** Both run along Savska Street and pass near many museums and faculties.\n\n### Buses: Reaching Beyond the City Center\n\nWhile trams dominate the city center, ZET's bus network of over 140 lines connects the central areas to suburban neighborhoods and hilly northern districts where tram tracks can't go. Buses are modern, air-conditioned, and share the same ticketing system as the trams.\n\n*   **Key Role:** Buses are essential for reaching destinations like Mirogoj Cemetery (Bus 106 from Kaptol) or Sljeme mountain.\n*   **Airport Connection:** Bus line 290 is the budget-friendly public transport link to Franjo Tuđman Airport.\n\n### The Zagreb Funicular: A Historic Ride\n\nConnecting the Lower Town (Tomićeva Street) to the Upper Town (Strossmayer Promenade), the Zagreb Funicular is one of the shortest public-transport funiculars in the world, with a track length of only 66 meters. The ride takes just 64 seconds.\n\n*   **Price:** A single ride costs €0.66.\n*   **Operating Hours:** 6:30 AM to 10:00 PM, daily.\n*   **Frequency:** Runs every 10 minutes.\n*   **Value:** It's more of a tourist attraction than a primary mode of transport, but it's a charming way to avoid the steep steps up to the Upper Town.\n\n## ZET Ticket Guide: Prices and How to Buy in 2026\n\nZagreb's ticketing system is user-friendly, with options for single journeys, daily passes, and multi-day tickets. Prices are among the most affordable in any European capital.\n\n### Types of Tickets and Current Prices\n\nZET offers time-based tickets, which allow unlimited transfers between trams and buses within the validity period.\n\n*   **30-Minute Ticket (€0.55):** Perfect for short hops within the city center. Must be purchased at a kiosk or via the app.\n*   **60-Minute Ticket (€0.95):** Standard for most single journeys.\n*   **90-Minute Ticket (€1.35):** Ideal for longer trips that involve multiple transfers or travel to the city's outer zones.\n*   **Daily Ticket (€4.00):** Unlimited travel for 24 hours from the first validation. This is the best value for any tourist planning to make more than four journeys in a day.\n*   **3-Day Ticket (€9.50):** Offers unlimited travel for 72 hours, perfect for a weekend stay.\n\n### Where to Purchase Your Tickets\n\nYou have several convenient options for buying ZET tickets:\n\n1.  **Tisak & iNovine Kiosks:** These small newsstands are located at nearly every major tram stop and are the most common place to buy paper tickets.\n2.  **ZET Ticket Offices:** Located at major transport hubs like Črnomerec, Savski Most, and Dubrava.\n3.  **Onboard from the Driver:** You can buy a single-use ticket directly from the tram or bus driver, but it is more expensive (approx. €2.00) and you must have small change. This option is not available for the shortest 30-minute tickets.\n4.  **Moj ZET Mobile App:** The official app allows you to purchase and validate tickets digitally using a credit card. It's the most modern and convenient method.\n\n### How to Validate Your Ticket\n\n**This is extremely important to avoid fines.** Upon boarding any tram or bus, you must validate your ticket.\n\n*   **Paper Tickets:** Insert the ticket into the yellow or orange ticket-stamping machines located near the doors. The machine will print the time and date on it.\n*   **Mobile App:** Scan the QR code located inside the vehicle with your app to activate your digital ticket.\n\nTicket inspectors (kontrolori) frequently check for valid tickets, and the fine for not having one is significant (around €30-€70).\n\n## Getting from Zagreb Airport (Franjo Tuđman) to the City Center\n\nZagreb Airport (ZAG) is located about 17 km southeast of the city center. You have three primary options for the journey.\n\n### The Official Airport Bus (Pleso Prijevoz)\n\nThis is the most popular and balanced option for travelers.\n\n*   **Route:** Runs directly from the airport to the Main Bus Station (Autobusni Kolodvor) in Zagreb.\n*   **Price:** Approximately €8.00 one-way.\n*   **Journey Time:** 35-45 minutes, depending on traffic.\n*   **Frequency:** Departs every 30 minutes throughout the day.\n\n### ZET Bus Line 290: The Local Option\n\nThis is the cheapest way to reach the city, as it is part of the standard public transport network.\n\n*   **Route:** Runs from the airport to the Kvaternikov Trg terminal, with a key stop at Velika Gorica.\n*   **Price:** A standard ZET ticket (€0.95 for 60 mins is usually sufficient).\n*   **Journey Time:** 60-75 minutes due to multiple stops.\n*   **Frequency:** Runs every 35 minutes.\n\n### Taxis and Ride-Sharing Services\n\nUber and Bolt are widely available and are generally cheaper than official airport taxis.\n\n*   **Uber/Bolt Price:** €15 - €25 to the city center.\n*   **Official Taxi Price:** €30 - €40.\n*   **Journey Time:** 25-35 minutes.\n\n## Accessibility on Zagreb Public Transport\n\nZagreb is progressively improving accessibility. A significant portion of the ZET fleet consists of modern, low-floor trams and buses, which are accessible to wheelchair users and passengers with strollers. These vehicles are marked with a wheelchair symbol.\n\nHowever, some older tram models are still in circulation and have high steps. If you require a low-floor vehicle, you may need to wait for the next one on the line. Real-time tracking apps can often show the type of vehicle operating a specific service.\n\n## Insider Tips for Using Zagreb's Public Transport\n\n*   **Validate, Always Validate:** It's the golden rule. Inspectors are discreet and fines are not negotiable. Don't risk it.\n*   **Daily Ticket for Sightseeing:** If you plan to visit multiple attractions in one day, the €4.00 Daily Ticket is almost always the cheapest and most convenient option.\n*   **Know Your Night Routes:** Night trams follow different, consolidated routes. The maps are posted at stops, but it's wise to check your route on the ZET website or Google Maps before heading out late.\n*   **Keep Right, Stand Left:** On escalators at transport hubs, locals follow the 'keep right' rule to let people pass on the left.\n*   **Rush Hour Crowds:** Between 7:30-9:00 AM and 4:00-5:30 PM, trams on major lines can be extremely crowded. If you have luggage, try to travel outside these peak hours.\n*   **Google Maps is Your Friend:** Google Maps has excellent integration with the ZET network, providing real-time departure information and the best route options.",
