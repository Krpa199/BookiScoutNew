  "content": "## Your Essential Guide to Zagreb's Best Attractions (2026)\n\nZagreb, Croatia's captivating capital, is a city of two distinct halves: the historic, cobblestoned Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and the bustling, Austro-Hungarian Lower Town (Donji Grad). This guide provides a detailed look at the top attractions, activities, and insider tips to help you discover the heart of this vibrant Central European metropolis.\n\n### Navigating Zagreb: Upper Town vs. Lower Town\n\nThe city's core is easily divided into two main areas, connected by the world's shortest funicular.\n\n*   **Upper Town (Gornji Grad):** This is the medieval heart of Zagreb. Expect winding cobblestone streets, gas lamps that are still lit by hand each evening, and major historical landmarks like St. Mark's Church and the Croatian Parliament.\n*   **Lower Town (Donji Grad):** Laid out in a 19th-century grid pattern, this area is home to grand museums, theaters, expansive parks, and the city's main commercial hub, Ban Jelačić Square.\n\n## Top Attractions in Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad)\n\nThe Upper Town is where Zagreb's history comes alive. It's a compact, walkable area best explored on foot.\n\n### St. Mark's Church (Crkva sv. Marka)\nSt. Mark's Church is arguably Zagreb's most iconic building, instantly recognizable by its colorful tiled roof. The roof, laid in 1880, features the medieval coat of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia on one side, and the emblem of the city of Zagreb on the other.\n*   **Location:** St. Mark's Square, Gornji Grad\n*   **Price:** Free to view from the outside. Interior access is often restricted to services.\n*   **Insider Tip:** The square is also home to the Croatian Parliament and the Government Palace, making it the political center of Croatia. It's quietest in the early morning for photos.\n\n### Zagreb Cathedral of the Assumption\nDominating the skyline with its twin spires, the Zagreb Cathedral is a monumental example of Gothic architecture. Its spires stand at 108 meters tall, making it the tallest building in Croatia. The cathedral has been undergoing extensive restoration following damage from earthquakes, but its treasury and stunning interior are open to visitors.\n*   **Location:** Kaptol 31, Kaptol\n*   **Opening Hours:** Typically 10:00 - 17:00 (Mon-Sat), 13:00 - 17:00 (Sun), but subject to services.\n*   **Price:** Free, but a donation of €2-3 is appreciated.\n\n### Museum of Broken Relationships (Muzej prekinutih veza)\nA globally acclaimed and innovative museum, this institution is dedicated to the emotional relics of failed relationships. Donated by people from around the world, each object, from a simple garden gnome to an old mobile phone, is accompanied by a personal story. It is a poignant, funny, and deeply human experience.\n*   **Location:** Ćirilometodska 2, Gornji Grad\n*   **Opening Hours:** 10:00 - 21:00 (Summer), 10:00 - 19:00 (Winter)\n*   **Price:** €7 for adults, €5.50 for students.\n*   **Rating:** 4.6★ on Google Maps.\n\n### Lotrščak Tower and the Grič Cannon\nFor the best panoramic views of Zagreb, climb the 13th-century Lotrščak Tower. Every day at noon, precisely, the Grič Cannon is fired from the tower's window, a tradition dating back to 1877 to mark midday. The blast is loud and startling, so be prepared!\n*   **Location:** Strossmayerovo šetalište 9, Gornji Grad\n*   **Price to Climb Tower:** €4 for adults.\n*   **Insider Tip:** Stand on the Strossmayer Promenade just before noon to watch the cannon firing ceremony up close.\n\n### Stone Gate (Kamenita Vrata)\nOnce the main eastern entrance to the medieval town, the Stone Gate is now a unique open-air chapel and shrine. It houses a painting of the Virgin and Child that miraculously survived a great fire in 1731. You will often see locals stopping to light a candle and say a quiet prayer.\n\n## Must-See Sights in the Lower Town (Donji Grad)\nThe Lower Town is the vibrant commercial and cultural hub, defined by its grand architecture and green spaces.\n\n### Ban Jelačić Square\nThis is the central square and the heart of Zagreb. A major transport hub for trams and a popular meeting point for locals, the square is dominated by a statue of Josip Jelačić. It’s surrounded by beautiful 19th-century buildings and is the stage for many public events and markets.\n\n### Dolac Market\nKnown as the \"Belly of Zagreb,\" Dolac is the city's main open-air farmers' market. Located just a few steps from the main square, its sea of red umbrellas is an iconic sight. Here you can find fresh produce, fish, meat, and local products like honey, olive oil, and *sir i vrhnje* (cottage cheese and cream). The market operates daily, but it's most vibrant in the morning.\n*   **Opening Hours:** Approximately 07:00 - 14:00 daily.\n*   **Insider Tip:** Visit before 10:00 AM for the best selection and to experience the market alongside local shoppers and the famous *kumice* (market ladies).\n\n### The Green Horseshoe (Lenuci Horseshoe)\nThis U-shaped system of parks and squares is a masterpiece of urban planning. A stroll through the Green Horseshoe takes you past several of Zagreb's most important cultural institutions, including the Croatian National Theatre, the Arts and Crafts Museum, and the Archaeological Museum. It's a perfect place for a relaxing walk or a picnic.\n\n### Tkalčićeva Street\nFormerly a creek that divided the districts of Kaptol and Gradec, Tkalčićeva is now the most charming and lively street in Zagreb. Lined with colorful buildings, it is packed with cafes, bars, and restaurants. It's the ideal spot to experience Zagreb's famous coffee culture by day and its nightlife after dark.\n\n## Unique Activities and Experiences\n\n### Ride the Zagreb Funicular\nConnecting the Lower Town (Tomićeva Street) with the Upper Town (Lotrščak Tower), the Zagreb Funicular is one of the shortest public-transport funiculars in the world. The track is only 66 meters long, and the ride lasts a mere 64 seconds.\n*   **Price:** €0.66, or valid with a public transport ticket.\n*   **Frequency:** Runs every 10 minutes from 06:30 to midnight.\n\n### Explore the Grič Tunnel\nBuilt during World War II as a bomb shelter, this 350-meter-long pedestrian tunnel runs beneath the Upper Town, connecting Radićeva and Mesnička streets. It's free to walk through and often hosts art installations or seasonal events, especially during Advent.\n\n### Experience \"Špica\" Coffee Culture\n*Špica* is a Saturday morning ritual in Zagreb. Locals dress in their best outfits and flock to the cafes in the Lower Town, particularly around Bogovićeva Street, to see and be seen while sipping coffee for hours. It’s a fantastic cultural experience.\n*   **Insider Tip:** To participate, grab a seat at an outdoor cafe between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM on a Saturday, order a *kava s mlijekom* (coffee with milk), and enjoy the people-watching.\n\n## Best Day Trips from Zagreb\nZagreb's central location makes it an excellent base for exploring other parts of Croatia.\n\n### Plitvice Lakes National Park\nThis UNESCO World Heritage site is a natural wonder, famous for its 16 terraced lakes connected by a series of stunning waterfalls. It's a must-see for nature lovers.\n*   **Distance:** Approximately 130 km (2 hours by car or bus).\n*   **Price:** Day tours from Zagreb average €80-€110 per person. Park entrance fees vary by season (€10 - €40).\n\n### Samobor\nA charming medieval town just a short trip from Zagreb. It's famous for its well-preserved town center and a local culinary delight: the *kremšnita*, a custard slice. It's the perfect half-day escape from the city.\n*   **Distance:** Approximately 25 km (30-40 minutes by bus).\n*   **Insider Tip:** Head to the pastry shop U Prolazu to try the most authentic *kremšnita*.",
