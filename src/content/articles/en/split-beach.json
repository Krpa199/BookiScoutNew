  "content": "## Your 2026 Guide to Split's Coastline: Beaches & Stays\n\nSplit, Croatia, masterfully blends ancient Roman history with the vibrant energy of a modern Mediterranean city. While Diocletian's Palace is its historic heart, the city's soul is found along its stunning Adriatic coastline. This guide provides a detailed look at the best beaches for every type of traveler and the prime beachfront apartments to make your base.\n\n## What are the best beaches in Split?\n\nSplit offers a diverse range of beaches, from sandy social hubs to secluded pebble coves. Each has a unique character, amenities, and atmosphere.\n\n### Bačvice Beach: The City's Social Hub\nBačvice is Split's most famous and accessible beach. Its unique status comes from its sandy seabed and shallow waters, making it the official home of *picigin*, a local ball game played year-round.\n\n*   **Location:** 1 km east of Diocletian's Palace (a 10-15 minute walk).\n*   **Type:** Primarily sandy, with some concrete platforms.\n*   **Best for:** Socializing, families with young children, experiencing local culture.\n*   **Amenities:** Numerous cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs. Sunbed and umbrella rentals are widely available.\n*   **Price:** A set of two sunbeds and an umbrella costs between €20 and €30 for the day.\n*   **Insider Tip:** While the main beach gets crowded, the small coves just east of the main bay offer a slightly quieter experience. For the best *fritule* (a local doughnut), look for the small stall near the eastern entrance, usually open from 11:00 to 19:00.\n\n### Kašjuni Beach: Chic and Secluded\nNestled at the base of Marjan Hill, Kašjuni Beach has transformed into one of Split's most stylish seaside destinations. The water here is exceptionally clear, and the vibe is more relaxed and upscale than Bačvice.\n\n*   **Location:** 3 km west of the Riva promenade, on the southern side of Marjan Park.\n*   **Type:** Fine pebble.\n*   **Best for:** Couples, groups of friends, and those seeking a trendy beach club atmosphere.\n*   **Amenities:** The popular Joe's Beach Lounge & Bar offers full service, including food, cocktails, and premium sun loungers. There is also a public area.\n*   **Price:** Premium sunbeds at the beach club can range from €30 to €50 per set. A cocktail costs approximately €12-€15.\n*   **Getting there:** Take city bus line 12 from the Riva or use a ride-sharing service (approx. €8-€10 from the Old Town).\n\n### Žnjan Beach: Family-Friendly Fun\nŽnjan is a large, sprawling complex of pebble beaches developed in recent years. Its expansive layout and numerous facilities make it the top choice for families and active beachgoers.\n\n*   **Location:** 4 km southeast of the city center.\n*   **Type:** Pebble.\n*   **Best for:** Families, sports enthusiasts, and those wanting easy access and parking.\n*   **Amenities:** Multiple beach bars, cafes, inflatable water parks, playgrounds, and volleyball courts. The area is well-equipped with showers and changing cabins.\n*   **Price:** Sunbed sets are more affordable here, typically €15-€25. Parking is widely available.\n*   **Insider Tip:** The westernmost part of Žnjan beach connects to Trstenik beach and is often less crowded, offering a more tranquil spot to relax.\n\n### Bene Beach: A Pine-Shaded Retreat\nLocated deep within the protected Marjan Forest Park, Bene Beach feels like a world away from the city bustle. Shaded by dense pine trees, its rocky shores and concrete platforms are perfect for escaping the summer heat.\n\n*   **Location:** Northern side of Marjan Park, approximately 5 km from the center.\n*   **Type:** Rocky, with concrete platforms and pebble entry points.\n*   **Best for:** Nature lovers, families, and those seeking shade and sports activities.\n*   **Amenities:** A restaurant, tennis courts, a children's playground, and an outdoor gym.\n*   **Getting there:** The area is car-free. You can take bus line 12 to the final stop and walk, or ride the tourist train that departs from the Riva.\n\n## Where to find the best beachfront apartments in Split?\n\nChoosing the right neighborhood is key to your Split experience. Each coastal area offers different advantages.\n\n### The Bačvice Neighborhood\nStaying in Bačvice offers the best of both worlds: you are less than a 15-minute walk from the historic Old Town and mere steps from the city's most popular sandy beach. This area is filled with a mix of traditional stone houses and modern apartment buildings. It is ideal for travelers who want to easily switch between sightseeing, swimming, and enjoying the nightlife.\n\n### The Žnjan Plateau\nThis is a modern, purpose-built residential area. Apartments here are typically newer, often featuring balconies, air conditioning, and access to private parking. While it's further from the Old Town (4-5 km), the area is self-sufficient with supermarkets and cafes, and it's perfect for families or groups who plan to rent a car and explore the wider Dalmatian region.\n\n### Meje and the Marjan Peninsula\nMeje is one of Split's most exclusive residential districts, located on the southern slopes of Marjan Hill. This area is home to luxurious villas and apartments with spectacular sea views. It offers a tranquil, upscale environment while still being within walking distance (20-30 minutes) of the city center. It's the prime location for accessing Kašjuni and Bene beaches.\n\n## Top-Rated Beachfront Apartments in Split\n\nTo help your search, here is a summary of highly-rated apartments in prime beach locations. Prices reflect a typical high-season nightly rate.\n\n| Apartment Name                   | Price (High Season) | Rating | Distance from Beach      |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Bacvice Sea View Luxury Apartment| €280/night          | 4.9★   | 50m from Bačvice Beach   |\n| Kašjuni Beachfront Villa         | €450/night          | 4.8★   | 100m from Kašjuni Beach  |\n| Modern Žnjan Apartment           | €190/night          | 4.7★   | 200m from Žnjan Beach    |\n| Trstenik Sunset Studio           | €160/night          | 4.6★   | 150m from Trstenik Beach |\n| Apartment Marjan Forest Retreat  | €220/night          | 4.9★   | 300m from Bene Beach     |\n\n\n## How much do beachfront apartments cost in Split?\n\nApartment prices in Split are highly seasonal and dependent on location, size, and amenities. Here's a realistic breakdown of what to expect for a one-bedroom apartment with a sea view:\n\n*   **Low Season (October - April):** Expect prices between **€80 - €150 per night**. This is an excellent time for budget-conscious travelers to enjoy the city without the crowds.\n*   **Shoulder Season (May - June, September):** Prices typically range from **€150 - €250 per night**. The weather is fantastic for swimming, and the city is vibrant but not overly crowded.\n*   **High Season (July - August):** This is the peak period, with prices ranging from **€250 - €450+ per night**. Booking 6-9 months in advance is highly recommended for the best properties.\n\nFactors that increase the price include a direct sea view, a private balcony or terrace, swimming pool access, and private parking.\n\n## Local Insider Tips for Split's Beaches\n\n1.  **Buy Sea Shoes:** With the exception of Bačvice, most of Split's beaches are pebbly. Simple rubber sea shoes (€10-€15 from local stalls) will make your swimming experience much more comfortable.\n2.  **Timing is Everything:** To secure a good spot, visit popular beaches like Kašjuni and Bačvice before 10:00. For a magical experience, go for a swim after 18:00 when the day-trippers have left and the water is still warm from the sun.\n3.  **Hydrate and Snack like a Local:** Most beaches have cafes, but you can save money by stopping at a local \"pekara\" (bakery) for a *burek* (savory pastry) and a \"tisak\" (kiosk) for cold drinks on your way to the beach.\n4.  **Understand the Bus System:** Bus line 12 is your key to the Marjan beaches (Kašjuni, Bene). It runs in a loop from the Riva. A ticket costs approximately €1.50 if purchased at a kiosk, or slightly more from the driver.",
