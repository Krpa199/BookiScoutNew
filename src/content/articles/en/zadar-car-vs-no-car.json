  "content": "## Zadar Transport: The Breakdown\n\nYour choice is simple. It's about what you plan to see. Here is the reality of getting around Zadar and its region.\n\n*   **Old Town (Poluotok):** Zadar's historic center is a pedestrian zone. You walk. A car is useless here, and buses drop you at the edge. \n\n*   **Beaches Beyond Kolovare:** The city beaches are crowded. The best spots are a short drive away in places like Petrčane or Nin. A car gets you there. A bus is slow and inconvenient.\n\n*   **Day Trips are Non-Negotiable:** To see Plitvice Lakes, Krka Waterfalls, or Paklenica National Park on your own schedule, you need a car. Bus tours are rigid and packed. Relying on intercity buses eats your entire day.\n\n*   **Parking is the Main Problem:** Finding parking near the Old Town is expensive and difficult in summer. Locals almost never try to park right next to the city walls, and for good reason. Look for accommodation with included parking.\n\n*   **Airport Transfer:** The airport shuttle bus is efficient and cheap, taking you directly to the main bus station. This is the one journey where public transport often makes more sense than a taxi or rental car pickup.",

  "quickAnswer": "Rent a car. Public transport is adequate only for staying within the city center. For exploring Dalmatia's best beaches and national parks like Krka or Plitvice, a car is essential for freedom and saving time. Don't rely on buses for day trips.",
