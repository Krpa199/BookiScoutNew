  "content": "## Zadar Parking: The Essentials\nFinding parking in Zadar is simple if you plan. Driving around looking for a spot is a waste of vacation time.\n\n*   **Parking Zones:** The city is divided into zones. Zone 0 is the most expensive and closest to the Old Town. Zones 1 and 2 are cheaper and further out. Payment is via meters or SMS.\n*   **Public Garages:** The best option for visiting the Old Town is the Ravnice public garage (Javna garaža Ravnice). It is large, secure, and a 5-minute walk to the Land Gate.\n*   **Apartments with Parking:** This is the only smart choice if you're staying multiple days with a car. Filter your booking search for 'free parking'. Make this a requirement.\n*   **The Peninsula:** You cannot drive or park inside the historic Old Town peninsula. It is a pedestrian zone. All parking is outside the city walls.\n*   **Free Parking:** Free street parking exists in residential areas like Brodarica, but it’s a 15-20 minute walk to the center. **Most travelers drastically underestimate the time wasted searching for street parking.**",
