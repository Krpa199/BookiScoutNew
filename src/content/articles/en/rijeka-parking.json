  "content": "## Parking in Rijeka: The Only Guide You Need\n\nDon't waste time circling the block. Parking in Rijeka's center is a challenge by design. Here is the direct strategy for dealing with your car.\n\n*   **Use the Garages:** The best options are the 'Delta' and 'Stari Grad' (sometimes called Školjić) public garages. They are central, secure, and you can pay by card. They are your most reliable choice for day trips.\n\n*   **Street Parking Zones:** The streets are divided into timed, paid zones. Zone 0 (red) is the core center with the shortest time limit. Pay at a machine or, better yet, use the Bmove app to manage it from your phone.\n\n*   **Apartment Parking Reality:** Many listings claim 'parking nearby,' which usually means fighting for a paid public spot. This is the marketing trick that causes the most headaches. Only book places that explicitly state 'private parking on-site' or 'garage parking'.\n\n*   **Look Beyond the Center:** If you must have a car, find accommodation in neighborhoods like Trsat or Pećine. Parking is generally easier there, and they often have properties with dedicated spots.\n\n*   **Forget Free Parking:** Do not waste your vacation hunting for free parking near the center. It does not exist. The only exception is temporary parking at a mall on the city's outskirts, like Tower Center Rijeka.",
