  "content": "## Where to Stay: Family Apartments\nRijeka isn't a resort town. You're looking for practical, well-located apartments. Your choice is between the city center for sights or the Kantrida neighborhood for the sea.\n\n## What to Do: Kid-Friendly Activities\nFocus on a few key attractions. Rijeka is compact, so you can cover a lot without exhausting your kids. The city is more about exploration than theme parks.\n\n*   **Apartment Tip:** City center apartments are convenient but often in old buildings. Always verify there's an elevator if you have a stroller or heavy luggage.\n*   **Best Location:** The Kantrida neighborhood offers modern apartments right next to pebble beaches and the swimming pool complex. It's the best choice for families who want easy beach access.\n*   **Top Sight:** Trsat Castle is a must. It's free to enter the courtyard, has great views, and kids can run around. The climb up the Petar Kružić Stairway is a different story. This is one of those things that sounds great until you try it with a toddler. Take city bus line 2.\n*   **Rainy Day:** Visit the Peek&Poke Computer Museum. It's small, hands-on, and a perfect indoor escape. It's surprisingly engaging for all ages.\n*   **Best View:** The Rijeka Astronomical Centre is excellent. It has a planetarium with kid-friendly shows and incredible views over Kvarner Bay. Check their schedule online for English language programs.",
