While these are must-see landmarks, the true soul of this Dalmatian city lies just beyond the polished stone and tourist throngs. For travelers seeking an authentic experience, Split offers a treasure trove of hidden gems, from secluded beaches and quiet neighborhoods to family-run taverns and breathtaking viewpoints.\n\nThis guide is designed to take you off the beaten path, revealing the spots that locals cherish. We'll explore the quiet corners of Marjan Hill, the culinary secrets of the Varoš district, and the cultural havens that many visitors miss. Get ready to discover the Split that exists beyond the postcards.\n\n### Marjan Hill: More Than Just a Park\n\nMarjan Forest Park is often mentioned as a green escape, but most tourists only walk to the first viewpoint. The real magic lies deeper within its network of pine-scented trails and hidden coastal spots.\n\n#### The Secluded Beaches: Kašjuni and Bene\nWhile Bačvice beach throngs with crowds, the southern slopes of Marjan Hill hide some of the city's best swimming spots. \n\n*   **Kašjuni Beach:** Located approximately 3.5 km west of the Riva, this recently updated pebble beach offers crystal-clear water and a more relaxed vibe. A section is managed by a beach club, but plenty of public space remains. You can reach it via the #12 bus or a 40-minute scenic walk. It boasts a 4.6★ rating for its clean water and stunning setting.\n*   **Bene Beach:** Tucked away on the northern side, Bene is a local family favorite. It's a mix of rocky slabs and concrete platforms shaded by pines. The water is shallow, making it perfect for children. Facilities include a restaurant, tennis courts, and a playground. It's the last stop on the #12 bus route.\n\n***Insider Tip:*** For ultimate seclusion, walk the coastal path between Kašjuni and Bene. You'll find numerous small, unnamed rocky coves where you can have a piece of the Adriatic all to yourself.\n\n#### The Hermitage Chapels and Telegrin Peak\nFor a dose of history and spirituality, seek out the 15th-century hermitage chapels built into the cliffs. The **St. Jerome (Sveti Jere) hermitage** is the most impressive. The path to it is steep but rewarding. Continue your ascent to **Telegrin Peak**, the highest point of Marjan (178 meters), for a 360-degree panoramic view of Split, the sea, and the islands of Šolta, Brač, and Hvar. This view far surpasses the one from the first terrace.\n\n## The Varoš and Radunica Neighborhoods: A Step Back in Time\n\nJust west and east of Diocletian's Palace lie two of Split's oldest neighborhoods, where the city's authentic, slower-paced life continues. \n\n### Exploring Varoš\nWest of the Riva, the Varoš neighborhood was once the home of fishermen and farmers. Today, its narrow, winding stone streets and charming houses offer a peaceful escape from the Old Town's hustle. It's here you'll find some of the city's best and most authentic restaurants.\n\n*   **Konoba Varoš:** A local institution with a 4.7★ rating, serving traditional Dalmatian fare like 'peka' (meat or octopus slow-cooked under embers) and fresh grilled fish. A main course typically costs between €25 and €40. It is located at Ban Mladenova 7, just a 600m walk from the Palace.\n*   **Vidilica Viewpoint:** At the edge of Varoš, where it meets Marjan Hill, is the Vidilica café and viewpoint. It offers the single best view of the city and harbor, especially at sunset. It's free to access the viewpoint, and a coffee costs around €3.\n\n### The Charm of Radunica\nEast of the Green Market, Radunica is another historic neighborhood with a distinct character. Known for its annual 'Days of Radunica' festival in late June, its streets are quieter and offer a glimpse into traditional residential life. It's a perfect area for a quiet evening stroll to admire the well-preserved stone architecture.\n\n## Authentic Culinary & Cultural Experiences\n\nTo truly know Split, you must taste its flavors and immerse yourself in its culture away from the tourist traps.\n\n### The Markets: Pazar and Peškarija\n*   **Pazar (Green Market):** Located just outside the Silver Gate of the Palace, this sprawling open-air market is where locals shop for fresh fruit, vegetables, cheese, and olive oil. Open daily from around 6:30 AM to 2:00 PM. \n    ***Insider Tip:*** Go early (before 9:00 AM) for the best selection and to experience the market at its most vibrant. Try the local specialties like 'soparnik' (a savory chard-filled flatbread).\n*   **Peškarija (Fish Market):** This historic market, located on Marmontova street, is an atmospheric spectacle of the Adriatic's bounty. The market is housed in a Secession-style building and is best visited in the morning when the catch is fresh. Prices are by the kilogram and change daily.\n\n### Underrated Museums and Galleries\nWhile the Palace cellars are famous, other cultural institutions offer deeper insights.\n\n*   **Meštrović Gallery:** Dedicated to Ivan Meštrović, Croatia's most renowned sculptor, this gallery is housed in his former residence. The collection of marble, stone, and bronze sculptures is world-class, and the building and its gardens overlooking the sea are stunning. It is located 2.5 km from the Riva and adult admission is €12. The gallery is closed on Mondays.\n*   **Archaeological Museum:** Founded in 1820, this is one of the oldest museums in Croatia. It holds a vast collection of artifacts from Greek, Roman, and early Christian periods discovered in and around Split and Salona. It's a quiet, scholarly alternative to the more crowded city museum. Standard opening hours are 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM, Tuesday to Saturday.\n\n## Off-The-Beaten-Path Day Trip: The Island of Šolta\n\nWhile most tourists flock to Hvar or Brač, the island of Šolta remains a wonderfully preserved, tranquil gem. A ferry from Split's main port takes just under an hour.\n\n*   **What to do:** Rent a scooter or car in the port town of Rogač and explore the island's interior. Visit the village of Grohote, the island's oldest settlement, and discover family-run farms producing world-class olive oil and Dobričić wine. \n*   **Best Beach:** The bay of Maslinica on the western tip is a stunningly beautiful fishing village with a quiet harbor and pristine coves for swimming.\n*   **Cost:** A round-trip passenger ferry ticket costs approximately €8-€10. Scooter rental for a day is around €40.",
