A 30-minute ticket costs just €0.53 if purchased at a kiosk (Tisak), while a 24-hour pass is approximately €3.98. The network covers the entire city and is the best way to get around.\n*   **Visit Dolac Market Early:** For the best experience and freshest produce at Zagreb's iconic open-air market, arrive before 10:00 AM. This is when locals do their shopping, and the atmosphere is most authentic.\n*   **Explore Beyond the Center:** While the Upper and Lower Towns are beautiful, take a tram to Maksimir Park. It's one of Europe's oldest public parks, home to the Zagreb Zoo and five artificial lakes, just 3 km from the main square.\n*   **Embrace the Coffee Culture:** Don't rush your coffee. Find a café on Tkalčićeva Street, order a *kava s mlijekom* (coffee with milk), and spend an hour people-watching. The price is usually around €1.80-€2.50.\n*   **Free Walking Tours:** Several companies offer 'free' (tip-based) walking tours starting from near the horseman statue in Ban Jelačić Square. They are an excellent way to orient yourself on your first day. A typical tip is €10 per person.",
