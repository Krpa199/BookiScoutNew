  "content": "## Your Stroller Strategy for Rijeka\n\nForget trying to conquer the old town alleys—it’s a stair-filled nightmare. Stick to the coast and you'll actually enjoy your day.\n\n*   **Molo Longo Breakwater:** This is your number one spot. It's a 1.7km long, completely flat paved path jutting into the sea. Great views, zero obstacles. Enter near the main market.\n\n*   **Kantrida to Opatija (Lungomare):** Start at the Kantrida swimming pools and walk the coastal path west. It's scenic, paved, and the easiest long walk you'll find.\n\n*   **Trsat Castle:** Do not take the stairs. Drive, take a bus, or use a taxi to get to the top. The castle courtyard is mostly flat and manageable once you are up there.\n\n*   **Korzo Pedestrian Street:** The main drag is wide and flat. It's fine for a short walk, but accessing shops or side streets often involves steps. Use it as a corridor, not a destination.\n\n*   **Ploče Beach:** This beach east of the city center has better ramp access and facilities than the older, more central city beaches. It's a safer bet for a family beach day.",
