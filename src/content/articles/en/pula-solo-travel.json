  "content": "## Pula Solo Safety: The Direct Facts\n\nPula is a straightforward destination for independent travelers. Crime is low, but don't be careless. Here is what you actually need to know.\n\n*   **Stay Central:** Book accommodation in the Old Town, Stoja, or Verudela. These areas are well-lit, populated, and have easy access to transport and amenities. Avoid isolated rentals on the city's outskirts.\n*   **Nighttime Transport:** After dark, do not walk through the unlit parts of Šijana Forest or along quiet port areas. Use Uber or Bolt; they are reliable and safer than hailing an unmarked taxi late at night.\n*   **Beach Smarts:** Busy beaches like Ambrela are prime spots for bag snatching. Travel light, never leave your valuables unattended on the sand, and consider a waterproof pouch for your phone and cash.\n*   **Honestly, the Galebove stijene cliffs are more trouble than they're worth for a solo trip.** The access is difficult and risky if you're alone, especially without proper footwear.\n*   **Bar Safety:** Stick to the main forum and pedestrian streets for evening drinks. Be mindful of your drink, and trust your gut. If a place feels off, leave.",
