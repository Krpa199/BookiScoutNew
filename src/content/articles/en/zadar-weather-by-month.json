  "content": "## Zadar Weather: The Only Guide You Need\n\nForget long weather reports. Here's the reality of Zadar's climate so you can plan your trip.\n\n## Peak Season: June - August\n\nThis is peak sun and peak crowds. Expect daytime temperatures of 28-32°C (82-90°F) and sea temperatures warm enough for everyone. July and August are the hottest and busiest. Book everything far in advance. Rain is rare.\n\n## Shoulder Seasons: April-May & September-October\n\nThis is the smart time to visit. September offers warm seas and fewer people. May is beautiful, but swimming in the sea before the last week of the month is a tourist move. Locals rarely do this, and for good reason—it's still cold.\n\n## Off-Season: November - March\n\nThis is for culture, not beaches. Expect cool temperatures, around 5-12°C (41-54°F), and frequent rain. The strong Bura wind can make it feel much colder. Many tourist-focused restaurants and shops close.\n\n*   **July & August:** Hottest months. High sun, high prices, big crowds.\n*   **June & September:** Best balance. Warm sea, sunny days, manageable crowds.\n*   **October - April:** Expect rain. The Bura wind is common and biting.\n*   **Sea Temperature:** Comfortable for swimming from early June to late September.\n*   **Packing:** Always bring a light jacket for evenings, even in summer.",
