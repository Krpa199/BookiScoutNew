  "content": "## Your Essential Guide to Split, Croatia\n\nSplit, Croatia's second-largest city, is a vibrant fusion of ancient history and modern Mediterranean life. Built around the sprawling Roman palace of Emperor Diocletian, the city's heart is a living museum. This guide provides factual, data-driven information on the top attractions and activities for your 2026 visit to Split.\n\n### What is the main attraction in Split?\n\nThe primary attraction in Split is Diocletian's Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site that forms the core of the city's Old Town. It is not a single museum but a complex of ancient structures that now house shops, restaurants, and residences.\n\n#### Diocletian's Palace: A Living Monument\nConstructed between the late 3rd and early 4th centuries AD, this former retirement residence of a Roman emperor is one of the world's most impressive Roman ruins. \n\n*   **The Peristyle:** This is the central courtyard of the palace, surrounded by magnificent Corinthian columns. It served as the main public square. Today, it's a popular meeting point where you can sit on ancient steps, often with live music in the evenings. The entrance to the Cathedral of St. Domnius is located here.\n*   **The Vestibule:** A grand, circular hall with an oculus open to the sky, this was the formal entrance to the emperor's private apartments. The acoustics are remarkable, and local Klapa (a cappella) groups often perform here.\n*   **The Cellars (Substructures):** The palace's basement halls are among the best-preserved ancient complexes of their kind. They mirror the layout of the imperial apartments above. A portion was used as a filming location for Daenerys's dragon dungeons in HBO's *Game of Thrones*.\n    *   **Entrance Fee:** €7\n    *   **Opening Hours:** 09:00 - 20:00 (summer), hours vary in off-season.\n*   **The Golden Gate (Porta Aurea):** The most ornate of the four palace gates, this was the main entrance used by the emperor. Today, it leads into the Old Town from the north, near the grand statue of Gregory of Nin (Grgur Ninski). \n\n**Insider Tip:** Touch the big toe of the Gregory of Nin statue for good luck. The bronze has been polished to a shine by millions of visitors doing the same.\n\n### Top Historical and Cultural Sites\n\n#### Cathedral of Saint Domnius\nOriginally built as Diocletian's Mausoleum, this octagonal building was converted into a cathedral in the 7th century, making it one of the oldest Catholic cathedrals in the world still in use in its original structure. The main draw for many is climbing the bell tower.\n\n*   **Bell Tower Climb:** The Romanesque tower, rebuilt in 1908, stands 57 meters tall. The climb involves a series of stone steps followed by a modern metal staircase. The panoramic 360-degree view of the palace, the Riva, and the Adriatic is worth the effort.\n    *   **Price:** Combined ticket for Cathedral, Treasury, Crypt & Bell Tower is approximately €10.\n    *   **Height:** 57 meters.\n    *   **Warning:** The final metal staircase is open and can be unnerving for those with a fear of heights.\n\n#### Riva Promenade\nThis palm-lined waterfront promenade is the city's living room. It stretches along the southern wall of Diocletian's Palace. It's the perfect place for a coffee, a meal, or simply to people-watch as ferries and yachts come and go. The promenade is busiest during the evening passeggiata (stroll).\n\n### Outdoor Activities and Nature\n\n#### Marjan Hill Park\nFor the best views of Split, head to Marjan Hill, the green lung of the city located just west of the Old Town. It's a vast park crisscrossed with walking and biking trails, pine forests, and secluded beaches.\n\n*   **Prva Vidilica (First Viewpoint):** The most accessible viewpoint. It's a 1.1 km walk (around 15-20 minutes) from the western end of the Riva. There is a cafe here, Caffe Bar Vidilica, where you can enjoy the stunning view with a drink.\n*   **Telegrin Peak:** The highest point of Marjan at 178 meters, offering an even more expansive view. It's about a 30-40 minute walk from the Prva Vidilica.\n*   **Beaches on Marjan:** The southern slopes of the hill are home to popular beaches like Kašjuni and Bene.\n\n### Best Beaches In and Around Split\n\nSplit offers several beaches accessible from the city center.\n\n#### Bačvice Beach\n*   **Type:** Sandy\n*   **Distance:** 1.2 km east of the ferry port (a 15-minute walk).\n*   **Known for:** Bačvice is famous as the birthplace of *Picigin*, a traditional ball game played in shallow water. It's a very popular, often crowded city beach with numerous cafes and nightlife options.\n\n#### Kašjuni Beach\n*   **Type:** Pebble\n*   **Distance:** 3.5 km from the Riva, on the southern side of Marjan Hill.\n*   **Known for:** A more scenic and relaxed atmosphere than Bačvice. It has beach bars and clear water. It is accessible by local bus line 12 or a 35-40 minute walk.\n\n### Top Day Trips from Split\n\nSplit's location makes it an ideal base for exploring Dalmatia. The ferry port is located just outside the palace walls.\n\n#### Hvar Island\nKnown for its vibrant nightlife, beautiful lavender fields (in early summer), and the stunning Pakleni Islands archipelago. The town of Hvar is a hub of Venetian architecture.\n*   **Getting there:** Kapetan Luka or Jadrolinija catamarans take approximately 1 hour. \n*   **Cost:** €20-€25 one-way.\n\n#### Brač Island (Zlatni Rat)\nHome to Zlatni Rat (Golden Horn), one of Croatia's most famous beaches. The beach is a unique V-shaped spit of pebbles that changes shape with the winds and currents.\n*   **Getting there:** Take the Jadrolinija car ferry from Split to Supetar on Brač (50 mins, ~€5). From Supetar, take a local bus to the town of Bol (50 mins, ~€6), where Zlatni Rat is located.\n\n#### Krka National Park\nFamous for its series of 7 stunning waterfalls, including Skradinski Buk, which you can admire from a network of wooden boardwalks. \n*   **Distance:** Approximately 85 km from Split.\n*   **Getting there:** The easiest way is via an organized bus tour (€30-€50 per person, excluding park entry). You can also drive or take a public bus to the town of Skradin.\n*   **Note:** Swimming is no longer permitted directly under the main waterfalls to preserve the ecosystem.\n\n### Food, Drink, and Local Markets\n\nTo experience local life, visit Split's markets.\n\n*   **Pazar (Green Market):** Located just outside the eastern wall of the palace (the Silver Gate). A bustling open-air market selling fresh fruit, vegetables, local cheese, and olive oil.\n    *   **Hours:** Daily, approx. 07:00 - 14:00.\n*   **Peškarija (Fish Market):** Located on the west side of the Old Town. It's a lively, authentic market selling the daily catch. Go early for the best selection.\n    *   **Insider Tip:** The market is built on sulfur springs, which is why there are very few flies despite the open-air fish.\n\nFor an authentic meal, look for a 'Konoba'. These are traditional taverns serving local dishes like grilled fish, 'peka' (meat and vegetables slow-cooked under embers), and black risotto.",
