  "content": "## Your Complete Guide to Split's Ferries in 2026\n\nThe Ferry Port of Split (Trajektna luka Split) is more than just a transit point; it's the gateway to the sun-drenched islands of the Adriatic. For any traveler in Dalmatia, understanding how to navigate this bustling hub is essential for a seamless island-hopping adventure. This guide provides all the necessary details, from ticket prices and schedules for 2026 to insider tips that will make your journey smoother.\n\n## Understanding Split Ferry Port\n\nThe port is conveniently located adjacent to the main bus and train stations, forming a central transportation nexus. It is situated approximately 500 meters, a 10-minute walk, from the eastern end of the Riva promenade and Diocletian's Palace. The port is divided into several piers (gat) and terminals, clearly marked for different destinations.\n\n### Port Facilities and Layout\n*   **Main Terminal Building:** Located at Gat Sv. Duje, this building houses the main ticket offices for Jadrolinija, the national ferry carrier. You'll also find cafes, ATMs, currency exchange offices, and public restrooms (cost: approx. €0.70).\n*   **Luggage Storage:** A dedicated luggage storage facility (garderoba) is located next to the main bus station, about 150 meters from the ferry terminal. Prices in 2026 are expected to be around €5-€7 per bag for 24 hours.\n*   **Piers:** The piers are numbered. Large car ferries to islands like Brač (Supetar) and Vis typically depart from the main piers, while fast passenger catamarans to Hvar, Korčula, and Bol often depart from the outer piers (Gat Sv. Petra). Always check your ticket for the correct pier number.\n\n## Major Ferry Companies Operating from Split\n\nTwo primary companies handle the vast majority of traffic from Split, each serving a different purpose.\n\n### Jadrolinija\nJadrolinija is the state-owned and largest ferry operator in Croatia. They run the large, blue-and-white car ferries as well as some passenger-only catamarans. \n*   **Services:** Car ferries, passenger catamarans.\n*   **Best for:** Travelers with vehicles, those going to main island ports like Supetar (Brač) and Stari Grad (Hvar), and budget-conscious foot passengers.\n*   **Key Feature:** Operates year-round with a reliable, albeit slower, service. Their car ferries have ample outdoor deck space and onboard cafes.\n\n### Kapetan Luka (Krilo)\nKapetan Luka operates a modern fleet of high-speed, passenger-only catamarans under the brand name Krilo. \n*   **Services:** Passenger-only catamarans.\n*   **Best for:** Faster journeys to popular destinations like Hvar Town, Korčula, and Dubrovnik. Ideal for day-trippers and those without a car.\n*   **Key Feature:** Significantly faster than car ferries. Seating is indoors and assigned, similar to an airplane. Booking well in advance is crucial as they sell out quickly.\n\n## How to Buy Ferry Tickets in Split\n\nBooking your tickets correctly and in advance can save you significant stress, especially during the peak season (June to September).\n\n### 1. Online Booking (Recommended)\nThis is the best method. Both Jadrolinija and Kapetan Luka have user-friendly websites and mobile apps. You can book months in advance, secure your spot, and receive a digital ticket with a QR code. For popular catamaran routes in July and August, booking 4-6 weeks in advance is advised.\n\n### 2. At the Ferry Port\nEach company has its own ticket kiosk or office at the port. The main Jadrolinija building is the most prominent. You can purchase tickets on the day of travel, but for popular routes, they may be sold out. This option is generally safe for the frequent Split-Supetar (Brač) car ferry but risky for catamarans to Hvar or Korčula.\n\n### 3. Authorized Travel Agencies\nNumerous travel agencies along the Riva and in the Old Town sell ferry tickets, often for a small service fee of €2-€3. This is a good backup option if you're having trouble online or want face-to-face service.\n\n## Popular Ferry Routes & Island Hopping from Split\n\nHere are the most sought-after island destinations accessible from Split.\n\n### Split to Hvar\n*   **To Hvar Town:** The most popular route. Served by fast catamarans (Kapetan Luka, Jadrolinija). The journey takes approximately 1 hour. In 2026, expect one-way prices of €23-€27.\n*   **To Stari Grad:** This is the car ferry port on Hvar, located 20 km from Hvar Town. Jadrolinija runs this route, which takes about 2 hours. A passenger ticket is cheaper (around €8), but you will need to take a bus or taxi to Hvar Town (approx. €25-€30 taxi fare).\n\n### Split to Brač\n*   **To Supetar:** The main port on Brač. This is the island's primary car ferry connection, with Jadrolinija running over 12 times a day in summer. The trip is 50 minutes. Passenger tickets are very affordable at around €5.50.\n*   **To Bol:** Home of the famous Zlatni Rat beach. This route is served by passenger catamarans from both Jadrolinija and Kapetan Luka. The journey takes about 1 hour. This route is less frequent than the Supetar one.\n\n### Split to Vis\nAs the furthest inhabited island from the mainland, Vis has fewer connections. Jadrolinija operates both a daily car ferry (2 hours 20 minutes) and a faster catamaran (85 minutes). Due to its popularity after the 'Mamma Mia!' movie, booking tickets to Vis well in advance is essential.\n\n### Split to Korčula\nOften called \"Little Dubrovnik,\" Korčula is a popular stop for island hoppers continuing south. Kapetan Luka and Jadrolinija run daily catamarans that take approximately 2.5 to 3 hours. These routes often continue to Dubrovnik, making them a scenic way to travel down the coast. Expect prices around €28-€32 for a one-way ticket in 2026.\n\n## Navigating the Port: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1.  **Arrive Early:** For car ferries, arrive at least 60-90 minutes before departure in peak season to get in the queue. For foot passengers on catamarans, 30-45 minutes is sufficient.\n2.  **Check Your Gate/Pier:** Your ticket will have the departure pier number ('Gat'). The port also has large electronic display boards showing departures, times, and pier numbers.\n3.  **Boarding with a Car:** Follow the signs for your destination. Port staff will direct you into the correct lane to queue for boarding. Have your tickets ready to be scanned.\n4.  **Boarding as a Foot Passenger:** For catamarans, you will queue at the specific vessel. For car ferries, foot passengers board via a separate ramp or staircase. You can store large luggage on designated racks on the car deck before heading to the passenger lounges.\n\n## Local Insider Tips for Using Split Ferries\n\n*   **Buy Snacks Beforehand:** While ferries have cafes, the selection is limited and more expensive. The bakeries ('pekara') and Konzum supermarket near the port are perfect for grabbing water, sandwiches, and pastries.\n*   **Choose the Right Side:** When traveling from Split to Hvar or Brač in the morning, sit on the right (starboard) side of the ferry for the best views of the coastline as you depart.\n*   **Jadrolinija Wi-Fi is Unreliable:** Don't count on the onboard Wi-Fi for anything important. Download your music, podcasts, or movies before you board.\n*   **Car Ferry Comfort:** The large Jadrolinija car ferries are often more comfortable than catamarans if the sea is choppy. They have open-air decks where you can stand, walk around, and enjoy the fresh sea breeze.\n*   **Beware of Taxi Scams:** Taxis waiting at the port can overcharge. If you need a taxi, use Uber or Bolt for a pre-quoted, fair price. The walk to the Old Town is short and flat, so only take a taxi if you have heavy luggage or mobility issues.",
