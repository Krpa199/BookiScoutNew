  "content": "## What Is the Museum of Broken Relationships?\n\nThe Museum of Broken Relationships is a physical and virtual public space created with the sole purpose of treasuring and sharing heartbreak stories and symbolic possessions. It is a museum about you, about us, and about the ways we love and lose. Founded in Zagreb by two artists, Olinka Vištica and Dražen Grubišić, the concept began as a traveling exhibition revolving around the notion of failure in relationships. After a breakup, they joked about creating a museum to house the leftover emotional baggage. This joke turned into a powerful artistic concept.\n\nThe museum's permanent collection is located in the beautiful Kulmer Palace in Zagreb's historic Upper Town (Gornji Grad). Each exhibit consists of a personal object—seemingly mundane or profoundly significant—accompanied by an anonymous text describing its relevance to a past relationship. The stories range from deeply moving and tragic to witty and cathartic. This universal theme of love and loss has resonated globally, earning the museum the Kenneth Hudson Award for the most innovative museum in Europe in 2011.\n\n## Planning Your Visit in 2026: Key Information\n\nTo make the most of your visit, it's essential to have the latest practical information. Here’s everything you need to know for a trip in 2026.\n\n### Location and How to Get There\n\nThe museum is located at **Ćirilometodska 2, 10000, Zagreb**, in the heart of the Upper Town. Its central location makes it easily accessible.\n\n*   **By Funicular:** The easiest way to reach the Upper Town is via the Zagreb Funicular, the world's shortest. The funicular's lower station is on Tomićeva Street, and the ride takes just 64 seconds. From the upper station, the museum is a 150-meter walk to the left.\n*   **On Foot:** From Ban Jelačić Square, the main square in Zagreb, it's a pleasant 10-15 minute uphill walk (approximately 800 meters) through the picturesque streets of the city center.\n*   **By Tram:** Trams 6 and 11 stop at Ban Jelačić Square, from where you can walk or take the funicular.\n*   **Nearby Landmarks:** The museum is located just 200 meters west of St. Mark's Church and 50 meters from the Croatian Museum of Naïve Art, making it easy to combine visits.\n\n### Opening Hours and Best Time to Visit\n\nThe museum is open daily, including on public holidays, with different hours for summer and winter seasons.\n\n*   **Summer Season (June 1st to September 30th):** Open from 9:00 to 22:00 (10 PM). The last admission is at 21:30 (9:30 PM). The extended summer hours are perfect for an evening visit after dinner.\n*   **Winter Season (October 1st to May 31st):** Open from 10:00 to 19:00 (7 PM). The last admission is at 18:30 (6:30 PM).\n\n**Insider Tip:** To avoid crowds, plan your visit on a weekday morning or during the late evening in the summer. The museum's intimate space can feel crowded during peak tourist hours (11:00 - 15:00), especially on weekends. An evening visit often provides a more contemplative and personal experience.\n\n### Ticket Prices and How to Buy (2026 Estimates)\n\nTicket prices are affordable, reflecting the museum's accessible philosophy.\n\n*   **Adults:** €8.00\n*   **Students (with valid ID) & Seniors (65+):** €6.50\n*   **Groups (15+ people):** €6.00 per person (must be arranged in advance)\n*   **Children (under 12):** Free\n\nTickets can be purchased directly at the museum's reception desk. Currently, online pre-booking is not mandatory but is recommended during the peak summer months to guarantee entry at your desired time. Payment can be made with cash (Euros) or major credit cards.\n\n## What to Expect Inside the Museum\n\nThe experience of visiting the Museum of Broken Relationships is unlike any other. It’s a journey through the collective human experience of heartbreak, presented with honesty, creativity, and a surprising amount of humor.\n\n### The Exhibition Concept: Objects and Stories\n\nThe museum is laid out in a series of clean, white-walled rooms that allow the objects and their stories to take center stage. Each display features an item donated by an anonymous individual from somewhere in the world. Next to each object is a small placard containing the story behind it, written in both Croatian and English. The captions specify the location and duration of the relationship.\n\nThe power of the exhibition lies in the juxtaposition of the ordinary and the extraordinary. A simple garden gnome, a pair of fuzzy handcuffs, an old Nokia phone, or an axe used to destroy an ex-lover's furniture are transformed into powerful artifacts of a life lived and a love lost.\n\n### Notable Exhibits and Highlights\n\nWhile the collection is constantly evolving as new donations arrive, some items capture the essence of the museum's spirit. You might encounter exhibits like:\n\n*   **The \"Ex-Axe\":** An axe from Berlin, Germany. A woman whose partner left her for another woman bought an axe to therapeutically chop all of her ex's furniture into small pieces. The axe serves as a symbol of cathartic release.\n*   **A Toaster:** From Denver, Colorado. The donor took the toaster from their ex's apartment, stating, \"When I moved out, and across the country, I took the toaster. That'll show you. How are you going to toast anything now?\"\n*   **Prosthetic Leg:** From a war veteran who fell in love with his physical therapist. The relationship ended, and the leg, which she helped him secure, remained as a permanent reminder of their time together.\n*   **A Wedding Dress:** Crammed into a jar. A poignant symbol of a marriage that ended, with the dress preserved but stripped of its original celebratory meaning.\n\nThe range of emotions is vast. One moment you may be laughing at a witty story of revenge, and the next, you may feel a profound sense of empathy for a story of deep loss.\n\n### The Museum's Atmosphere and Emotional Impact\n\nThe atmosphere is quiet and reflective. Visitors move slowly from one exhibit to another, engrossed in the stories. It is an emotional rollercoaster, but not a depressing one. The overarching feeling is one of connection and shared humanity. Realizing that heartbreak is a universal experience, described in countless different ways, can be incredibly comforting and life-affirming.\n\n## The Brokenships Café and Museum Shop\n\nYour visit doesn't have to end with the last exhibit. The museum has a wonderful café and shop that are destinations in their own right.\n\n### Grabbing a Coffee at the Brokenships Café\n\nLocated on the ground floor with a lovely courtyard, the Brokenships Café is a perfect spot to decompress and reflect on your visit. It serves excellent coffee, local craft beers, wine, and light snacks. It’s a popular spot for locals as well as tourists, with a relaxed and artistic vibe. The prices are reasonable, with an espresso costing around €2.00 and a craft beer around €4.50.\n\n### Unique Souvenirs from the Museum Shop\n\nForget generic souvenirs. The museum's gift shop is curated with clever, well-designed items that reflect its theme. Popular items include the \"Bad Memories Eraser,\" tote bags with witty quotes, and a beautifully designed book containing the best stories and objects from the collection. It's a great place to find a truly unique gift from Zagreb.\n\n## Insider Tips for Your Visit\n\n*   **Allocate Enough Time:** Don't rush your visit. Plan for at least 60-90 minutes to read the stories and absorb the exhibits. Many visitors find themselves staying for up to two hours.\n*   **Visit the Confessional:** At the end of the exhibition, there is a digital confessional where you can anonymously share your own story of a broken relationship. It's a cathartic way to participate in the museum's mission.\n*   **Check for Temporary Exhibitions:** The museum often hosts temporary exhibitions or special events. Check their official website, brokenships.com, before your visit for any updates.\n*   **Bring Tissues:** While many exhibits are funny, some are deeply moving. It's not uncommon for visitors to feel a strong emotional response.\n\n## The History and Global Impact of the Museum\n\nThe Museum of Broken Relationships was born from the personal breakup of its founders in 2006. What started as a small, traveling collection of donated items grew into a global phenomenon. The core idea was to create a space for healing by giving people a place to value the emotional legacy of a failed relationship, rather than simply discarding it.\n\nThe concept has since expanded, with a second permanent museum opening in Los Angeles, USA, and numerous traveling exhibitions that have visited over 50 cities worldwide, from London to Singapore. The Zagreb location remains the original and the heart of the project, a testament to the city's creative and resilient spirit.\n\n## Attractions Near the Museum of Broken Relationships\n\nLocated in the historic Upper Town, the museum is surrounded by other key Zagreb attractions. You can easily create a half-day itinerary:\n\n*   **St. Mark's Church:** Just a 200-meter walk away, famous for its colorful tiled roof depicting the coats of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia, Slavonia, and the city of Zagreb.\n*   **Croatian Museum of Naïve Art:** Located right next door, this gallery showcases the work of self-taught Croatian artists and is a unique cultural experience.\n*   **Lotrščak Tower:** A 5-minute walk (350 meters) from the museum. Climb to the top for stunning panoramic views of the city and witness the firing of the Grič cannon, which happens daily at noon.\n*   **Stone Gate (Kamenita Vrata):** One of the last remaining gates of the old city walls, now a shrine. It's about a 400-meter walk from the museum.",
