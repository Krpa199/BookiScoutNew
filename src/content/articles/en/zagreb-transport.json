  "content": "## Getting Around Zagreb: The Ultimate 2026 Transport Guide\n\nWelcome to Zagreb, Croatia's vibrant and easily navigable capital. Unlike many sprawling European capitals, Zagreb's transportation system is refreshingly straightforward, making it a joy for visitors to explore. The city center is a walker's paradise, but for venturing further, an efficient network of trams, buses, and modern ride-sharing services has you covered. This guide provides all the data, prices, and insider tips you need to navigate Zagreb like a local in 2026.\n\n### How to Get from Zagreb Airport (ZAG) to the City Center\n\nFranjo Tuđman Airport (ZAG) is located approximately 20 km southeast of the city center. You have several reliable options to reach your accommodation.\n\n#### 1. Airport Shuttle Bus (Pleso Prijevoz)\nThis is the most popular and cost-effective option for tourists.\n*   **Operator:** Pleso Prijevoz\n*   **Price:** €8.00 one-way\n*   **Travel Time:** 35-45 minutes\n*   **Frequency:** Departs every 30 minutes. The schedule is synced with flight arrivals and departures.\n*   **Destination:** Zagreb's main bus station (Autobusni Kolodvor), which is a few tram stops from the main square.\n*   **Insider Tip:** You can buy tickets online in advance or directly from the driver (cash or card). The bus stop is located directly outside the arrivals terminal.\n\n#### 2. Public Bus (ZET Line 290)\nThis is the cheapest, but also the slowest, public transport option.\n*   **Operator:** ZET (Zagreb's public transport authority)\n*   **Price:** €1.50 (for a 90-minute ticket)\n*   **Travel Time:** 60-75 minutes\n*   **Frequency:** Every 35 minutes.\n*   **Destination:** Kvaternikov Trg (Kvaternik Square), with multiple stops along the way. This is a local bus, so expect more stops than the shuttle.\n*   **Good to Know:** You'll need to buy a ticket from the Tisak newsstand at the airport or use the ZET app. This is a good option for budget travelers not in a hurry.\n\n#### 3. Taxi and Ride-Sharing (Uber/Bolt)\nFor ultimate convenience, especially with luggage, taxis and ride-sharing are excellent choices.\n*   **Official Taxis:** A licensed taxi from the airport taxi rank will cost approximately €30-€40. Always ensure the meter is running. The journey takes about 25-35 minutes depending on traffic.\n*   **Uber & Bolt:** Both services operate legally and efficiently from Zagreb Airport. The designated pickup area is clearly marked. A ride to the city center typically costs **€20-€25**, making it a more affordable option than a standard taxi. Prices can surge during peak times.\n\n## Using Zagreb's Public Transport (ZET)\n\nThe city's public transit system, known as ZET (Zagrebački električni tramvaj), consists of a dense network of blue trams and buses. It's affordable, reliable, and the primary way locals get around.\n\n### The Zagreb Tram (Tramvaj)\n\nThe tram is the heart and soul of Zagreb's transport. With 15 daytime lines and 4 nighttime lines, it covers almost the entire city.\n\n#### How to Buy Tickets\n*   **Tisak Kiosks:** The easiest method. These small newsstands are located at most major tram stops. Simply ask for a 'tramvajska karta'.\n*   **ZET Offices:** You can buy all ticket types at official ZET sales points.\n*   **Onboard (from driver):** This is possible but not recommended. It's more expensive (€1.50 for a single ticket) and you need exact change. Drivers may refuse if they are running behind schedule.\n*   **Mobile App:** The `mojZET` app allows for digital ticket purchases, but it can be tricky for tourists to set up. Sticking to kiosks is often simpler.\n\n#### Ticket Types and Prices (2026 Estimates)\n*   **30-Minute Ticket:** €0.60. Perfect for short hops within the city center.\n*   **60-Minute Ticket:** €1.00. Good for journeys that might involve a transfer.\n*   **90-Minute Ticket:** €1.50. For longer cross-city trips.\n*   **Daily Ticket (Dnevna karta):** €4.00. Offers unlimited travel on all ZET trams and buses until 4:00 AM the next day. Highly recommended if you plan to make 4 or more journeys in a day.\n*   **3-Day Ticket:** €9.30. A great value for short city breaks.\n\n#### How to Use and Validate Your Ticket\n**CRITICAL STEP:** You MUST validate your paper ticket immediately upon boarding. Look for the yellow or orange validation machines inside the tram. Insert your ticket (usually arrow-first) until you hear a stamping sound. Failure to validate can result in a fine of up to €60 if inspected.\n\n### The Zagreb Funicular (Uspinjača)\nConnecting the Lower Town (Tomićeva Street) to the Upper Town (Strossmayer Promenade), the Zagreb Funicular is one of the shortest in the world.\n*   **Length:** 66 meters\n*   **Ride Time:** 64 seconds\n*   **Price:** €0.70\n*   **Operating Hours:** 6:30 AM to 10:00 PM, daily.\n*   **Insider Tip:** While you can easily walk up the adjacent stairs, the funicular is a charming piece of Zagreb history and a fun experience. Your standard ZET tickets are not valid here; you must buy a separate ticket at the station.\n\n## Taxis and Ride-Sharing in the City\n\nNavigating the city with a private car is fast and convenient.\n\n### Official Taxis\nLook for licensed taxis with a sign on the roof and a visible meter inside. The largest and most reputable company is Radio Taxi Zagreb.\n*   **Starting Fare:** ~€2.50\n*   **Price per Kilometer:** ~€1.20\n*   **Hailing:** You can hail them on the street, find them at designated taxi ranks, or call them.\n\n### Uber and Bolt\nBoth Uber and Bolt are extremely popular and often cheaper than traditional taxis for city journeys. The apps work exactly as they do elsewhere in the world.\n*   **Availability:** Excellent within the city and surrounding areas.\n*   **Average Cost for a 5 km ride:** €5-€7\n*   **Benefit:** Upfront pricing, easy payment via the app, and no language barrier issues with drivers.\n\n## Is Zagreb a Walkable City?\n\nAbsolutely. The core of Zagreb, encompassing the historic Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and the bustling Lower Town (Donji Grad), is best explored on foot. Major attractions like the Zagreb Cathedral, St. Mark's Church, Dolac Market, and Ban Jelačić Square are all within a 15-20 minute walking radius of each other.\n\n*   **Pedestrian Zones:** Streets like Tkalčićeva and Bogovićeva are lined with cafes and are entirely pedestrian-friendly.\n*   **Recommendation:** Use public transport to get to a central point, then spend your day exploring different neighborhoods on foot.\n\n## Cycling and Bike Rentals\n\nZagreb is becoming increasingly bike-friendly, with a growing network of dedicated bike lanes.\n\n*   **Nextbike:** This is the city's public bike-sharing system. You can register via their app, find a bike at one of the many stations, and pay per ride or with a subscription.\n*   **Pricing:** A 'Pay as you go' ride typically costs €0.70 per 30 minutes.\n*   **Insider Tip:** Cycling along the Sava River is a beautiful and flat route, perfect for a leisurely afternoon.\n",
