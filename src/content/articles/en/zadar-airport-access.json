  "content": "## Getting From Zadar Airport to the City\n\nGetting from Zadar Airport (ZAD) to the city is simple. The airport is only 12km from the center. Don't overcomplicate it. Here are your options.\n\n*   **Airport Bus (Liburnija):** This is your default choice. The bus is timed with incoming flights and waits just outside the terminal. It drops you at the main bus station (Autobusni Kolodvor) and then the Old Town entrance.\n\n*   **Rideshare (Uber & Bolt):** Both apps work well in Zadar and are generally cheaper than taxis. Open both on arrival and pick the cheaper one. Expect to pay €20-€25.\n\n*   **Taxis:** Taxis are available directly outside arrivals. This is the most expensive choice, often running €30-€40. Confirm the price before starting the trip or make sure the meter is on.\n\n*   **Private Transfers:** Pre-booked private transfers are an overpriced solution for a 20-minute journey. The other options are too easy and efficient to justify the high cost.\n\n*   **Car Rental:** All major companies operate at ZAD. Book far in advance for summer travel. This only makes sense if you plan to explore the region beyond the city itself.",
