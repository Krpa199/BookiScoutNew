  "content": "## Myth 1: A Rental Car is Essential for Exploring\n\n**The Myth:** Look at a map and you'll think a car is the only way to see Rijeka and its surroundings. Every travel blog seems to recommend it.\n\n**The Reality:** This is the single biggest mistake you can make. Rijeka's city center, the Korzo and its adjacent streets, is a pedestrian zone. Outside of that, the city is a tight web of steep, narrow, one-way streets. Parking is a competitive sport, with public garages often full and street parking costing around €1-€2 per hour, if you can even find a spot.\n\n*Insider Perspective: Watching tourists in rental cars try to navigate the roads around the main market is a local pastime. Don't be the entertainment.*\n\n**The Better Alternative:** Walk. The entire downtown core is best explored on foot. For anything further, like Trsat Castle or the Pećine and Kantrida beaches, the city bus is your best friend. Autotrolej, the public bus company, is efficient and cheap. A single-ride ticket is about €1.50, and you can easily buy them at any kiosk (tisak) or often tap a contactless card on board. If you plan on a day trip to Istria or Plitvice, rent a car for that specific day from an in-city location.\n\n## Myth 2: Taxis from the Airport are the Obvious Choice\n\n**The Myth:** You land, you're tired, you grab the first taxi or Uber you see. It's the standard airport-to-city routine.\n\n**The Reality:** Rijeka Airport (RJK) isn't actually in Rijeka. It’s on the island of Krk, a 30 km drive away. That “convenient” taxi ride will set you back a staggering €40-€50. For a 45-minute ride, that's a terrible value and a rough start to your budget.\n\n**The Better Alternative:** The official airport shuttle bus. It's operated by Autotrans and is perfectly timed to meet arriving flights. It costs about €10 per person and takes you directly to the main bus station at Jelačićev Trg in the city center. It's comfortable, reliable, and what 90% of locals and savvy travelers use. You can buy a ticket from the driver or online in advance. There is no simpler or more cost-effective way.\n\n## Myth 3: The Public Bus System is Too Complicated for Tourists\n\n**The Myth:** Faced with a foreign bus map and Croatian-only signs, many tourists give up and either walk until their feet hurt or overpay for short taxi rides.\n\n**The Reality:** You only need to know about three bus lines to conquer the city. The network is centered around Jelačićev Trg. \n*   **Line 2:** Takes you directly up the hill to Trsat Castle, saving you a 45-minute, very steep climb. \n*   **Line 1:** Runs east-west along the coast, perfect for getting to Pećine beach. \n*   **Line 7:** Connects the western part of the city, including Kantrida beach and its iconic stadium.\n\nHonestly, the Rijeka City Card is marketed as a must-have, but it's only worth it if you're a museum fanatic. For transport alone, buying individual or daily tickets is more practical.\n\n**The Better Alternative:** Download the Moovit or Google Maps app, which have accurate bus schedules for Rijeka. Identify the 2-3 key destinations you have that aren't walkable (like Trsat). Go to the main bus station, find the clearly marked stop for your line, and hop on. It’s far less intimidating than it looks.\n\n## What Actually Matters\n\nGetting around Rijeka isn't about having the most powerful transport; it's about using the *right* transport for the job.\n\n*   **For the city core:** Your own two feet. It's the only way.\n*   **For hills and beaches:** The city bus. It's cheap, efficient, and saves your legs.\n*   **For getting to/from the airport:** The shuttle bus. Period.\n*   **For day trips:** A one-day car rental or the excellent regional bus network from the main station.\n\nDon't fall for the myth that you need a car for your whole trip. It's a liability, not a convenience. Embrace the local way—walk and ride the bus—and you'll have a much smoother, cheaper, and more authentic experience.",

      "question": "But isn't having a car better for exploring Istria or nearby islands?",
      "answer": "For day trips, yes, a car offers flexibility. But for your time *in* Rijeka, it's a burden. The smart move is to rent a car for just the 24 hours you need it from a city-center location. Don't book one for your entire stay and pay for it to sit in an expensive garage."

    {
      "question": "Is Uber or Bolt reliable in Rijeka?",
      "answer": "Yes, they are active and reliable for short trips within the city, and often cheaper than traditional taxis. However, they are still a poor choice for the long, expensive journey from Rijeka (Krk) Airport compared to the airport shuttle."
