  "content": "Rijeka is a stunning port city, a gateway to the Kvarner islands, and a place where you'll want to stay connected to share photos, navigate its streets, or check ferry times. But when it comes to mobile data, most visitors are working off old, bad advice. Let's clear things up so you can stay online without getting overcharged.\n\n## Myth 1: You Must Buy a SIM Card at the Airport\n\n**The Reality:** Airport kiosks are convenient, but they prey on that convenience. The SIM card packages sold at airport arrivals are almost always 'tourist-focused' deals that are significantly more expensive than what you'll find just 15 minutes away in the city center. \n\n**The Better Alternative:** Walk or take the bus into Rijeka and find a dedicated provider store like **T-Centar (Hrvatski Telekom)** or **A1 Centar**. Even easier, stop at any of the ubiquitous red **Tisak** or **iNovine** kiosks you'll see on nearly every corner. Ask for a prepaid SIM ('SIM na bonove'). A starter pack with a solid week's worth of data (around 10 GB) will typically cost you about €10-13. **Save your money here and spend it on a good meal at Konoba Fiume instead.**\n\n## Myth 2: You Need a Huge, 'Unlimited' Data Plan\n\n**The Reality:** Unless you plan on streaming 4K movies all day on the beach, you don't need an unlimited plan. Rijeka, like most of Croatia, has excellent and free Wi-Fi coverage in cafes, restaurants, apartments, and public squares. Your actual mobile data usage will be for Google Maps, WhatsApp, and social media on the go.\n\n**The Better Alternative:** Look for weekly packages ('tjedne opcije'). For example, Hrvatski Telekom and A1 both offer prepaid tariffs where you can activate a 7-day bundle with 7-10 GB of data. This is more than enough for the average traveler. **Paying extra for unlimited 'Balkan' data is usually not worth the cost unless you're on a multi-country road trip.**\n\n## Myth 3: Coverage is Poor Outside the Main City\n\n**The Reality:** This might be true in some parts of the world, but Croatia's mobile infrastructure is top-notch. The major providers—**Hrvatski Telekom, A1, and Telemach**—boast over 98% 4G/LTE population coverage. 5G is widespread throughout Rijeka itself. \n\n**The Better Alternative:** Don't stress. The same SIM card you buy in Rijeka will give you a strong, fast signal whether you're hiking in Učka Nature Park, exploring the historic town of Kastav, or taking a ferry to the island of Krk. *As an insider, I can tell you that I've streamed music flawlessly on a boat between Cres and Lošinj using a standard local prepaid SIM.*\n\n## Myth 4: eSIMs Are a Hassle and Not Widely Available\n\n**The Reality:** The opposite is true. Local Croatian providers have fully embraced eSIM technology, and it's the most convenient option for modern phones. You can buy one online from the provider's website, receive a QR code via email, and activate it the moment you land, bypassing physical stores entirely.\n\n**The Better Alternative:** Before your trip, check the websites for A1 Croatia or Telemach Hrvatska for their prepaid eSIM offers. The process is straightforward and gets you online faster than any other method. This is the ultimate pro-move for a seamless arrival.\n\n---\n\n### What Actually Matters\n\nForget the myths. Here’s what you should focus on:\n1.  **Convenience vs. Cost:** Decide if paying double at the airport is worth skipping a 5-minute stop at a kiosk in town. (Hint: it's not).\n2.  **Your Actual Needs:** Be realistic about your data consumption. A 10 GB plan is a huge amount of data when you're mostly using Wi-Fi.\n3.  **Provider Choice:** Honestly, there isn't a bad choice between Hrvatski Telekom and A1. Both have stellar coverage and competitive pricing. Pick whichever store you see first.\n\n*Insider's perspective: Locals often just top up their 'na bonove' (prepaid) SIMs at a Tisak kiosk or a grocery store – it’s a simple, no-fuss process you can easily adopt after your initial purchase.* Following this local approach is the smartest way to handle connectivity in Rijeka.",
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "But isn't getting a SIM at the airport just more convenient?",
      "answer": "Marginally. But that convenience can cost you nearly double. A Tisak kiosk is never more than a few blocks away in the city center, and the process of buying and activating a SIM takes less than five minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I visit other Balkan countries like Bosnia or Montenegro?",
      "answer": "Standard Croatian prepaid plans do not include free roaming in non-EU Balkan countries. In this specific case, you would need to purchase a special roaming package or consider a regional eSIM provider like Airalo, but this is more expensive than buying a local SIM in each country."

  "quickAnswer": "Most travelers get this wrong: You don't need a pricey airport SIM for great connectivity in Rijeka. Local prepaid SIMs from A1 or Hrvatski Telekom offer fantastic 4G/5G coverage city-wide and on nearby islands for under €15, and are easily bought in town.",
