  "content": "## Your Ultimate Guide to Zagreb in 2026\n\nWelcome to Zagreb, the vibrant and often-overlooked capital of Croatia. While many visitors flock to the Dalmatian coast, Zagreb offers a rich tapestry of Austro-Hungarian architecture, a thriving café culture, quirky museums, and a palpable energy. It’s a city where medieval history meets modern life, creating a destination perfect for a city break. This guide covers the absolute best things to see and do in Zagreb for 2026.\n\n## Explore the Historic Upper Town (Gornji Grad)\n\nZagreb's Upper Town is the city's medieval heart, a charming labyrinth of cobblestone streets, gaslights that are still lit by hand each evening, and historic landmarks. The easiest way to reach it is by taking the Zagreb Funicular, one of the shortest in the world with a track length of just 66 meters.\n\n### St. Mark's Church: The Iconic Rooftop\nThe centerpiece of the Upper Town is St. Mark's Church (Crkva sv. Marka), located in the square of the same name, which also houses the Croatian Parliament and Government buildings. The church is world-famous for its colorful tiled roof, which displays the medieval coat of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia on the left, and the emblem of the city of Zagreb on the right. While the interior is often closed to tourists, the exterior is a must-see photo opportunity.\n\n*   **Insider Tip:** Visit in the late afternoon for the best light on the roof tiles. From April to October, you might catch the changing of the guard ceremony in St. Mark's Square on weekends around noon.\n\n### Museum of Broken Relationships: A Unique Emotional Journey\nOne of Zagreb's most famous attractions, the Museum of Broken Relationships (Muzej prekinutih veza), is a poignant and innovative exploration of heartbreak. The collection features personal objects and stories donated by people from around the world, each one representing a past relationship. It's surprisingly cathartic and deeply human.\n\n*   **Opening Hours:** 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM daily\n*   **Ticket Price:** Approximately €7 for adults.\n*   **Location:** Ćirilometodska 2, Upper Town\n\n### Lotrščak Tower and the Grič Cannon\nFor the best panoramic views of the city, climb the 13th-century Lotrščak Tower. Every day for over 140 years, a cannon (the Grič Cannon) is fired from the tower precisely at noon to mark the time. The tradition is so ingrained in city life that locals often set their watches by it.\n\n*   **Price:** Around €4 to climb the tower.\n*   **Insider Tip:** Arrive just before 12:00 PM to witness the cannon firing up close. Be prepared—it's very loud!\n\n## Discover the Bustling Lower Town (Donji Grad)\n\nThe Lower Town is Zagreb's commercial and cultural hub, characterized by grand 19th-century buildings, wide avenues, beautiful parks, and countless museums and shops.\n\n### Ban Jelačić Square: The Heart of Zagreb\nTrg bana Jelačića is Zagreb's central square and the city's main meeting point. Dominated by a large statue of Josip Jelačić, the square is a constant hive of activity, surrounded by cafes and shops. It's the primary hub for the city's iconic blue trams and the perfect starting point for exploring the Lower Town.\n\n### Zagreb Cathedral: A Gothic Masterpiece\nThe Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a monumental landmark on the Zagreb skyline. Its twin spires, standing at 108 meters, are the tallest in Croatia. The cathedral has been damaged by several earthquakes throughout its history, most recently in 2020, and is undergoing continuous restoration. Entry is free, and its stunning neo-Gothic architecture and treasury are well worth a visit.\n\n*   **Opening Hours for Tourists:** Typically 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM (Mon-Sat), 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM (Sun). Check locally as times can vary due to services or restoration.\n*   **Price:** Free, but donations are appreciated.\n\n### Dolac Market: The Belly of Zagreb\nJust a few steps from the main square is Dolac, Zagreb's main open-air farmers' market. Instantly recognizable by its red umbrellas, this is where locals come for fresh produce, cheese, meat, fish, and homemade products. It's a feast for the senses and a wonderful place to experience daily life in the city.\n\n*   **Operating Hours:** Daily, approximately 7:00 AM to 2:00 PM (earlier on Sundays).\n*   **Insider Tip:** Bring cash (Euros). Try some 'paški sir' (Pag cheese) and a piece of 'sirnica' (a sweet cheese pastry) from one of the bakeries.\n\n## Zagreb's Quirky Museums and Green Spaces\n\nZagreb is known as a city of museums, with more per capita than almost any other capital. Beyond the historical, there are many unique and fun options.\n\n### Museum of Illusions\nA fantastic and interactive experience for all ages, the Museum of Illusions (Muzej Iluzija) will challenge your perception with its mind-bending exhibits, holograms, and puzzles. It's a great rainy-day activity and perfect for families.\n\n*   **Ticket Price:** Around €10 for adults.\n*   **Location:** Ilica 72, Lower Town\n\n### Maksimir Park and Zagreb Zoo\nEscape the city buzz in Maksimir Park, a vast 18th-century English-style park located about 4 km east of the center. With dense forests, sprawling meadows, and five lakes, it's a perfect spot for a walk, run, or picnic. The park is also home to the Zagreb Zoo.\n\n*   **Zoo Ticket Price:** €4 on weekdays, €6 on weekends.\n*   **Getting There:** Take tram number 11 or 12 from Ban Jelačić Square.\n\n### The Grič Tunnel: A WWII Shelter Turned Walkway\nBuilt during World War II as a bomb shelter, the Grič Tunnel runs for 350 meters under the Upper Town. Today, it serves as a public walkway and occasional event space, connecting Radićeva and Mesnička streets. It's free to enter and offers a unique, slightly eerie shortcut.\n\n## Culinary Experiences: What to Eat and Drink\n\nZagreb's food scene is a delightful mix of Central European and Mediterranean influences.\n\n### Try Traditional Croatian Dishes\nDon't leave without trying *štrukli*, a delicious baked or boiled pastry filled with cottage cheese, which can be either savory or sweet. La Štruk is a popular restaurant dedicated entirely to this dish. Also look for *kulen* (spicy sausage) and *pršut* (cured ham).\n\n### Experience the Café Culture on Tkalčićeva Street\nUlica Ivana Tkalčića is a long, winding street lined with colorful buildings, cafes, bars, and restaurants. This is the epicenter of Zagreb's social life. Find a seat on an outdoor terrace, order a *kava s mlijekom* (coffee with milk), and watch the world go by. This is known locally as *špica*, the art of seeing and being seen, especially on Saturday mornings.\n\n### Sample Local Craft Beer and Rakija\nZagreb has a burgeoning craft beer scene. Check out pubs like The Garden Brewery or Mali Medo for a taste of local brews. For something stronger, try *rakija*, a potent fruit brandy. The most popular varieties are *šljivovica* (plum) and *medica* (honey).\n\n## Practical Information for Your Zagreb Trip (2026)\n\n### Getting Around Zagreb\nThe city center is very walkable. For longer distances, the ZET tram network is efficient and easy to use. Tickets can be purchased at kiosks (look for 'Tisak') or via the ZET mobile app.\n\n*   **Tram Ticket Prices (2026 estimate):** €0.53 for a 30-minute ticket, €0.93 for 60 minutes. A daily ticket costs around €3.98.\n\n### Best Time to Visit\n*   **Spring (April-June) & Autumn (September-October):** Pleasant weather, ideal for sightseeing.\n*   **Summer (July-August):** Hot and lively, though many locals leave for the coast.\n*   **Winter (November-December):** Cold but magical, thanks to the award-winning Advent in Zagreb Christmas markets.\n\n### Currency and Costs\nCroatia uses the Euro (€). Zagreb is more affordable than many Western European capitals.\n\n*   **Average Costs:** A cup of coffee: €2-€3. A meal at a mid-range restaurant: €15-€25 per person. A pint of local beer: €3-€4.",
