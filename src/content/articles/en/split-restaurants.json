  "content": "## A Culinary Journey Through Split: Croatia's Dalmatian Gem\n\nSplit is more than just a gateway to the stunning Croatian islands; it's a vibrant culinary destination where ancient Roman walls house a thriving food scene. The city’s gastronomy is built on the pillars of Dalmatian cooking: incredibly fresh seafood from the Adriatic, sun-ripened vegetables from the local markets, fragrant olive oil, and centuries-old recipes passed down through generations. From rustic, family-run taverns called *konobas* to elegant fine-dining establishments, eating in Split is an experience that connects you directly to the heart of Dalmatian culture.\n\nThis guide provides a comprehensive look at the best restaurants and must-try local cuisine for your visit in 2026. We've included specific price points, locations, and insider tips to help you navigate Split's delicious offerings like a local.\n\n## What to Eat in Split: Must-Try Dalmatian Dishes\n\nBefore you choose a restaurant, it's essential to know what local specialties to look for on the menu. These dishes represent the soul of Dalmatian cooking.\n\n### Crni Rižot (Black Risotto)\nThis is arguably Dalmatia's most iconic dish. Its dramatic black color comes from cuttlefish or squid ink, which imparts a rich, savory, and deep sea flavor. The risotto is slow-cooked with cuttlefish meat, garlic, wine, and olive oil, resulting in a creamy and intensely flavorful dish. A high-quality crni rižot is a must-try; expect to pay between €18 and €25 for a serving.\n\n### Pašticada\nOften served at celebrations and family gatherings, Pašticada is a testament to the art of slow cooking. It's a beef stew featuring a top round of beef marinated for at least 24 hours in vinegar or wine, then slowly braised for hours with prunes, carrots, cloves, and bacon. The result is a tender, melt-in-your-mouth meat with a complex sweet-and-sour sauce, traditionally served with homemade gnocchi.\n\n### Peka\nMore a method of cooking than a specific dish, *peka* is a true Croatian tradition. Meat (typically veal or lamb) or octopus is placed in a shallow metal pan with potatoes and vegetables, drizzled with olive oil and herbs, and then covered with a domed, bell-like lid (*cripnja*). The entire pan is buried in hot embers and left to cook for several hours. This process steams and roasts the ingredients simultaneously, making them incredibly tender and flavorful. Note: Most restaurants require you to order peka 3-4 hours or even a day in advance.\n\n### Grilled Fish (Riba sa Žara)\nWith the Adriatic at its doorstep, Split excels at simple, perfectly grilled fish. Restaurants source their catch daily from the local fish market. Common varieties include sea bass (*brancin*), sea bream (*orada*), and john dory (*šampjer*). The fish is typically grilled over wood embers with just olive oil, salt, and pepper, and served with a side of *blitva s krumpirom* (Swiss chard with potatoes).\n\n### Soparnik\nThis savory pie is a protected cultural heritage food from the region. It consists of two thin layers of dough filled with Swiss chard, onions, and parsley, then baked on a hearth under embers. After baking, it's brushed with garlic-infused olive oil. You can find it at the Pazar (Green Market) for an authentic, budget-friendly snack for around €3-4 per slice.\n\n## Best Fine Dining Restaurants in Split\n\nFor a special occasion or a sophisticated culinary experience, these restaurants blend modern techniques with traditional Dalmatian ingredients.\n\n### ZOI\nPerched on the southern wall of Diocletian's Palace, ZOI offers one of the most breathtaking dining settings in Split.
