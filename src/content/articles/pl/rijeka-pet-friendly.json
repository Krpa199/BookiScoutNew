  "content": "## Finding Pet-Friendly Apartments\nUse booking sites with a \"pets allowed\" filter. Focus on apartments in the Trsat or Kantrida neighborhoods for easier access to green spaces. Always confirm pet policies and extra fees directly with the host before booking.\n\n## Best Dog-Friendly Locations\n*   **Kantrida Dog Beach:** This is the best and most popular spot. It's a dedicated pebble beach with showers for dogs, located just west of the main Kantrida beach.\n*   **Brajdica Dog Beach:** Located on the city's east side, this is another official dog beach. It's smaller but a solid alternative.\n*   **Molo Longo:** This 1.7km long breakwater is the city's main promenade. It’s perfect for a long, leashed walk with great views of the harbor.\n*   **Učka Nature Park:** A short drive away, this park offers extensive hiking trails for a proper workout. Keep your dog leashed as per park rules.\n*   **Trsat Castle Area:** The parks and paths around the castle are great for a walk. Avoid taking your dog down the main Korzo promenade on a Saturday morning. Locals rarely do this, and for good reason; it's just too crowded.",
