  "content": "## Your Ultimate Guide to Parking in Zadar\n\nZadar, the historic gem of the Dalmatian coast, is a city best explored on foot. Its marble streets, Roman ruins, and famous Sea Organ are all nestled within the pedestrian-friendly Old Town peninsula (Poluotok). But to enjoy this walkability, you first need to solve the modern puzzle: where to leave your car.\n\nNavigating parking in a historic European city can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. This guide provides a clear, authoritative breakdown of your options, from convenient paid garages to elusive free spots, ensuring you spend less time circling and more time enjoying everything Zadar has to offer.\n\n### Understanding Zadar's Parking Zones\n\nThe city of Zadar manages its street parking through a clear color-coded zone system. The closer you are to the Old Town, the more expensive and time-restricted the parking becomes. Payment is managed by the local company Obala i Lučice.\n\n#### Zone 1 (Red Zone)\nThis is the most central and expensive zone, covering the streets immediately surrounding the Old Town walls. \n*   **Price:** Approx. €1.60 per hour.\n*   **Time Limit:** Usually a maximum of 3 hours.\n*   **Hours of Operation:** Typically Mon-Sat 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM. Sundays and public holidays are often free, but always check the signs.\n*   **Best For:** Quick drop-offs or short visits if you're lucky enough to find a spot.\n\n#### Zone 2 (Yellow Zone)\nZone 2 offers a fantastic balance of proximity and price. It's located just a 5-10 minute walk from the Old Town gates.\n*   **Price:** Approx. €0.80 per hour.\n*   **Time Limit:** No time limit, you can pay for the whole day.\n*   **Best For:** All-day parking for most visitors. This is the sweet spot for value and convenience.\n\n#### Zones 3 & 4 (Green/White Zones)\nThese zones are further out and primarily serve residential areas. While cheaper, they require a longer walk (15-25 minutes) to the main attractions.\n*   **Price:** Approx. €0.40 - €0.60 per hour.\n*   **Best For:** Budget-conscious travelers who don't mind a walk or those staying in accommodation in these areas.\n\n### How to Pay for Parking in Zadar\n\nYou have several modern and convenient options for paying for street parking:\n\n1.  **Parking Meters (Automati):** Look for the blue machines on the sidewalks. Most accept coins (EUR), and some newer ones may accept contactless card payments. You must display the printed ticket clearly on your dashboard.\n2.  **SMS Payment:** This is the most common method for locals. Send an SMS with your car's license plate number (with no spaces, e.g., ZD123AB) to the number displayed on the parking sign for your specific zone. You'll receive a confirmation SMS.\n3.  **Parking Apps:** The easiest option for tourists. Download an app like **Bmove** or **PayDo**. You can add your vehicle and credit card, and the app uses GPS to identify your zone, allowing you to pay and extend your parking time remotely from your phone.\n\n### Best Paid Parking Garages & Lots\n\nFor guaranteed, secure parking without the hassle of searching for a street spot, these are your best bets. They are located just outside the pedestrianized Old Town.\n\n#### Poluotok Public Garage (Garaža Poluotok)\nLocated at Ulica-poljskog-križa, this multi-story garage is a popular and secure choice. It's about a 400-meter walk to the Sea Gate (Morska Vrata) entrance of the Old Town. It's well-lit, covered, and a great option for hot summer days or overnight parking.\n*   **Price:** ~€1.50 - €2.00 per hour.\n*   **Capacity:** 350+ spaces.\n\n#### Ravnice Parking Lot\nThis is the largest and most strategically located open-air parking lot. Situated right next to the city walls and Queen Jelena Madijevka Park, it's just a 200-meter stroll to the iconic Land Gate. Because of its size and location, it's often the most recommended spot for first-time visitors.\n*   **Price:** ~€1.30 per hour or a daily ticket for ~€10.\n*   **Capacity:** 500+ spaces.\n\n### Where to Find Free Parking in Zadar\n\nFinding free parking close to Zadar's Old Town is extremely difficult, especially during the peak summer season (June-August). However, it is possible if you are willing to walk.\n\nYour best bet is to head towards the residential neighborhoods of **Puntamika** or **Borik**, which are located about 2.5-3.5 km northwest of the Old Town. You can often find free street parking there and then take a scenic 30-40 minute walk along the coast or hop on a local bus (Lines 5 or 8) or an Uber/Bolt to the center.\n\nAnother option is the large parking lot at the **Supernova Shopping Center**, located about 4 km from the center. While technically for customers, it can be used for a few hours. **Frankly, hunting for a free spot more than 2km from the Old Town is a false economy; the time you waste and the potential cost of a bus or Uber negate the savings.**\n\n### Parking Fines: The 'Daily Ticket' Trap\n\nIf you overstay your paid time or fail to pay for parking, you won't get a traditional fine. Instead, you'll find a 'Dnevna Karta' (Daily Ticket) on your windshield. This is effectively a penalty fare for the entire day in that zone, which can range from €15 to €30.\n\nYou can usually pay it online, at a post office, or at the Obala i Lučice office. It's crucial to pay it, especially with a rental car, as the rental agency will be notified and will charge you the amount plus a hefty administrative fee.\n\n### Insider Tips for a Stress-Free Parking Experience\n\n1.  **Arrive Early or Late:** The best time to find a good spot in the Ravnice lot or Zone 2 is before 9:30 AM or after 7:00 PM when day-trippers have started to leave.\n2.  **Prioritize Accommodation with Parking:** When booking your hotel or apartment, filter for places that include parking. This is the single biggest stress-reducer. **Booking accommodation with dedicated parking is the single best decision you can make for a stress-free trip to Zadar. Skip any apartment in the center that doesn't offer it.**\n3.  **Use Google Maps Satellite View:** Before you arrive, scout potential parking areas on Google Maps. You can gauge the size of lots and the number of street spots in neighborhoods just outside the main zones.\n4.  **Have Coins Ready:** Even if you plan to use an app, it's always wise to have €5-€10 in coins as a backup for the meters.\n5.  **Don't Park Illegally:** Do not park on sidewalks, in front of gates, or in marked residential spots. Towing is actively enforced and is an expensive, vacation-ruining experience.",
