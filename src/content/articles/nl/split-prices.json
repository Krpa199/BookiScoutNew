  "content": "## Split, Croatia: A Comprehensive Price Guide for 2026\n\nSplit, the vibrant heart of the Dalmatian coast, is a city where ancient Roman walls meet the sparkling Adriatic Sea. It's a top destination for its history, stunning islands, and lively atmosphere. But how much does a trip to this Croatian gem actually cost? This guide provides a detailed breakdown of expected expenses for your 2026 visit, helping you budget for an unforgettable holiday.\n\n### Daily Budget Estimates for Split\n\nSplit can cater to a wide range of budgets. The cost of your trip will heavily depend on your travel style, the time of year (July and August are peak season), and your choices in dining and accommodation.\n\n*   **Budget Traveler:** €60 - €80 per day. This budget covers a hostel bed, meals from bakeries and supermarkets, free activities like hiking Marjan Hill, and using local buses.\n*   **Mid-Range Traveler:** €120 - €180 per day. This allows for a private apartment (Apartman), daily meals at traditional restaurants (konobas), a few paid attractions, and a ferry trip to a nearby island.\n*   **Luxury Traveler:** €300+ per day. This budget includes a boutique hotel within the palace walls, fine dining experiences, private boat tours, and taxis or private transfers.\n\n--- \n\n## How Much Does Accommodation Cost in Split?\n\nAccommodation will be your largest expense. Prices fluctuate significantly between the low season (October-April) and the high season (June-September).\n\n### Hostels\nHostels are a fantastic option for solo travelers and those on a tight budget. A dorm bed in a well-rated hostel like **Ćiri Biri Bela (4.8★)** or **Split Guesthouse & Hostel (4.7★)** costs between **€30 and €50** per night during peak season. Prices can drop to €20 in the shoulder season. Most are located within a 1km radius of the Diocletian's Palace.\n\n### Private Apartments (Apartmani)\nThe most popular accommodation choice in Croatia. Renting an *apartman* offers great value, often including a small kitchen. \n*   **Studio outside the center:** €70 - €100 per night\n*   **One-bedroom inside or near the Old Town:** €120 - €180 per night\nBooking platforms like Booking.com and Airbnb have thousands of listings.\n\n> **Insider Tip:** Look for accommodation in neighborhoods like Varoš or Bačvice. They are a short 10-15 minute walk (approx. 800m) to the Old Town but can be 20-30% cheaper than staying directly within the palace walls.\n\n### Mid-Range & Boutique Hotels\nA comfortable room in a 3-star or 4-star hotel will cost between **€150 and €250** per night. Hotels like **Hotel Peristil (4.6★)**, located right next to the Silver Gate, offer incredible locations. Expect prices to be at the higher end of this range in July and August.\n\n### Luxury Hotels\nFor a premium experience, 5-star hotels such as **Hotel Park Split (4.7★)** or the **Radisson Blu Resort & Spa (4.6★)** offer sea views, swimming pools, and top-tier service. Prices start at **€350** per night and can easily exceed €600 for suites with a sea view.\n\n--- \n\n## Cost of Food and Drink in Split\n\nDalmatian cuisine is a highlight, and you can enjoy it without breaking the bank.\n\n### Groceries and Markets\nSelf-catering is a great way to save. A weekly grocery shop for two people at a supermarket like **Konzum** or **Tommy** will cost around **€70-€90**. Don't miss the **Green Market (Pazar)**, open daily from 06:30 to 14:00, for fresh local fruit, vegetables, cheese, and olive oil at excellent prices.\n\n### Casual Eats and Bakeries\n*   **Burek or Pastry:** €2.00 - €3.50 from a local *pekara* (bakery).\n*   **Slice of Pizza:** €2.50 - €4.00.\n*   **Ice Cream (Kugla):** €2.00 per scoop.\n*   **Ćevapi (grilled minced meat):** A filling portion costs €8 - €12 at a casual grill spot like **Kantun Paulina (4.7★)**.\n\n### Mid-Range Restaurants & Konobas\n*Konobas* are traditional taverns serving authentic Croatian food. A main course (e.g., grilled fish, black risotto) typically costs **€18 - €30**. A two-course meal with a glass of local wine will be around **€35 - €50** per person. Recommended spots include **Konoba Fetivi (4.6★)** and **Villa Spiza (4.7★)**.\n\n> **Insider Tip:** The further you walk from the main Riva promenade, the more reasonable the prices become. Explore the narrow side streets of the Old Town for hidden culinary gems.\n\n### Fine Dining\nFor a special occasion, restaurants like **Zrno Soli (4.7★)** in the ACI Marina offer gourmet meals with stunning views.

It costs **€8** one-way and takes about 30-40 minutes, dropping you at the main bus station.\n*   **Uber/Bolt:** A ride will cost between **€30 and €40**, depending on demand.\n*   **Taxi:** The most expensive option, costing **€45 - €55**.\n\n### Local Buses\nThe city bus network, operated by **Promet Split**, is efficient.
