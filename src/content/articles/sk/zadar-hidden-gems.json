  "content": "## Zadar Beyond the Postcards\n\nEveryone goes to the Sea Organ and Sun Salutation. You can do better. Zadar's best experiences are found just beyond the main tourist path. Go where the locals go.\n\n## Top Off-Beat Spots\n\n*   **Varoš Neighborhood:** Get lost in these narrow backstreets behind the main forum. This is where you find authentic, family-run *konobas* (taverns) with better food and prices than the waterfront.\n\n*   **Kolovare Beach:** This is Zadar's city beach, south of the Old Town. It’s a concrete-and-pebble beach packed with locals, not tourists. It has a multi-level diving platform and a real neighborhood vibe.\n\n*   **Petrčane Village:** Take a 20-minute bus ride out of the city. It’s a quiet fishing village with small beaches and clear water. A perfect escape for half a day.\n\n*   **Foša Harbor:** Just outside the Land Gate, this small, picturesque harbor is full of wooden fishing boats. It’s far more charming than the main ferry port. Honestly, the Sun Salutation is less magical than the photos suggest.\n\n*   **Queen Jelena Madijevka Park:** Climb the stairs next to the Land Gate to the oldest public park in Croatia. It's quiet, green, and offers fantastic views over Foša Harbor and the islands.",
